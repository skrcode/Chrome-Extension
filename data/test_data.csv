0,"Why does the iron pillar located in the Qutub complex in Delhi never rust?

Dr. Balasubramaniam from Indian Institute of Technology did a material sciences analysis of the iron, and here’s what he found (in easy words):

Delhi’s Iron Pillar has more amount of Phosphorus than the usual.

If you melt pig iron and add phosphorous in it, it will start breaking up. The iron would never come together and make bond with each other. So, what the manufacturers do is that they take out phosphorous out of the molten iron. (Just like you filter out tea leaves out from your tea, where tea leaves are your phosphorous molecules in an analogy.)

What ancient Indians did was they never took out the phosphorous out of the pillar. They welded the cylindrical pieces of wrought iron. To remove the phosphorous from it, they started hitting it from all sides with a hammer. Phosphorous got pushed towards the surface of the cylinder from inside. So inside had no more phosphorous while outer surface had a protective layer of phosphorous. It was a win-win."

3,"What is one thing you caught your parents doing that you wish you had never seen?
.
.
.

Going anonymous as I don’t want my parents to know about how much impact this had on me.

I was about 16 years of age when this happened. It was the last week of the month and a few of our family friends visited us for chit chat after dinner. When they showed up and said, “hey guys, lets have ice cream together,” my parents said yes very reluctantly and they just went inside one of the bedrooms. I was not sure why they were not excited as I was sure as hell thrilled to eat ice cream. After some time, when they didn’t return from the room, I opened the door and walked in to see, that they had opened up my piggy bank and were counting money (pennies, coins, some notes). I was shocked that they had opened my piggy bank and when they saw me standing, they said “honey, sorry we have to use your money for ice cream now as papa is out of money for the month and will return it back on 1st of the next month when salary is received”. I just looked that their pale but hopeful faces staring at me. For some reason I understood the situation, and they gave me 180 rupees to run down to the store to buy some ice cream, which I did and we all had it with the visitors.

I really wish I had not seen this as it created a sub image of my parents (being helpless and short of money) in my mind which I can’t get rid of. It changed me in a way that I simply decided to earn money so desperately that my parents never are short of money by end of the month. In that process, I went away from them for years to stay abroad and earn, ran behind money and stability like crazy hell. Gave up on all entertainment and fun in youth to just focus on money and getting family out of financial troubles. Today we are not millionaires but have bunch of properties in US and India, earn very well, have good money to spend.

But I wished I never ever get to see that sorry state of financial affairs for my parents again. I saw it once and wish to never repeat it. Have spent my life sacrificing a lot to ensure it."
4,"What is the best thing you have ever heard a teacher say?
.
.
.

You know that one kid that doesn’t give a flying FUCK about his education? I have one in my class right now and his name is Andrew. Now I go to an all boys school and of course since there are no girls around we were acting like complete idiots. One day an essay was due for history the next day. So Andrew decided to provoke the teacher by asking for an extension. Of course he did’t word it like that. This is the conversation that they had in the middle of class. It reminded me of that scene in Top Gun when Tom Cruise is talking in class.

Teacher “Remember guys the essay on the Mongols is due tomorrow so get on it.”

Andrew “What if I have a hot date?” (Chuckles to his buddies)

Teacher “Use your other hand” (turns around to the board)

I SWEAR TO GOD THE ENTIRE CLASS FLIPPED ITS SHIT. No one would expect a teacher to make a masturbation joke in class. So while the entire class was rioting Andrew’s face was beet red. It took the entire period to calm down. People were yelling and screaming like maniacs.

“Andrew you just got fucking owned!”

“Holy shit Andrew you got Roasted!”

“Someone contact a burn ward!”

“Damn Andrew!”

“Mr. Burns you are savage!””

Even the English class next to us came over to find out the fucking riot that was going on. Andrew has never talked back to any teacher ever since. I have a newfound respect for my history teacher.

5,"Q :- Why are so many decent people single nowadays?

A :- 
Because,

Your school life just went by goofing around, studying or being interested in anything apart from dating.
Even in this time, if you had a crush, neither you nor your crush approached each other for a date. Blinded by the charm of your crush, your marks wake you up.
And your school life is done in studies, friends, wistful glances to your crush, results and a nice farewell.
You enter college. You have forgotten your crush.
Your are in relationship with your college assignments and supplementaries in different subjects are your soul mates.
A separate college is your dating venue where you go quite a few times to clear misunderstandings of your low grades. :P
Forget about date, your amazing marks can't even set a job for you.
So, when college is over, the race to set your career starts. And you get more inclined in setting your job. The job takes up majority of your time leaving you only worthy of snoozing comfortably on weekends.
Unless you find someone in college, it gets more and more difficult to find someone interesting in job.
Half of the office is either married or already committed.
Panic starts to set in. You want to feel the romance in your life. So you turn to dating sites.
You go to tinder. And you are bombarded with ready to hook up people. The overwhelming freaking texts makes you ultimately uninstall it.
Your friends are married. The few guys in your friend circle are committed. Even their other friend circle is full of married and committed people.
You start mentally dating some celebs, fictional characters, TV characters. And the actors who play this.. Ironically, even those actors are either married or committed.
Basically everyone around you is with someone, except you.
Congratulations, Now you are 29 years old. You are the only single person in every job you switch. You have started loving this single-hood, as your friends start whining about relationships. So you decide to remain single. You have achieved your happily ever after in sleeping, eating and watching awesome series. (God, please bring GOT back soon.. :’( .. )
Meanwhile, your parents are going crazy over matrimony sites. But you couldn’t care less, because you have learnt to live a single life, enjoying movies alone, not talking late nights and sleeping like a log. :P
So this is the flowchart how decent people remain single these days. :P
Edit : Adding few more points to the answer, as I couldn't recall them at that time.

Answering Amrutha Shanbhag question what happens to these people later on :-

(This is totally my thought process right now. This whole answer has been, actually.)

Every day you are becoming more and more cynical about relationships and couples. As Gopalkrishna Vishwanath (Thank you sir. :) )rightly pointed out, you see couples, separating, recently married. You are looking for one happy couple, you personally know, but you fail to find.
Every holiday spot is reserved for your marriage. “You can go to Goa with your husband. Why go with friends?”
Your parents take you to a spiritual world. Every other day is some fast, every other plant is supposed to be given water to, early morning. All because, the neighbor’s daughter is getting married following these steps.
Doing all this, you are asked to wholeheartedly ask for a nice life partner in your mind. But you end up asking a new job or a salary rise. :P
You are slowly turning into a universal fault finding person. Every profile your parents put forward to you, is met with a dead glaze and poker face.
Every random marriage news gets only one exclamation from your parents, “When will you get married. Now its scaring me, beta.”
You feel shitty for giving them so much tension, so you take active interest in the profiles. But because you are shitty, the interest is only alive till your parents have not gone back to bed. They retire to sleep and you are back to watching serials. :P
The fear of marriage has solidified in your mind. So, much that being rejected on matri sites is now giving you utmost happiness.
An extremely good profile, is no longer elating you. It scares you , “Bloody hell, how do I reject him/her”
Your parents are tired of this cycle. They get paranoid the moment you say “Not interested” to any profile. They ask you if you like someone. They even comment that you should have found someone in college for yourself. Ultimately it’s all our fault. *Much wow*
There was a time when you had a crush on good looking people and would like to date them. Now you are a firm believer of “Just watch from distance and be happy. No need to get cozy”.
Your parents, meanwhile, tell you to go to abroad for work (Indians love NRIs so by this logic, you’ll get married easily.) You wobble your head, clueless, and then and there the trip to abroad starts and ends. :P
Ultimately, your goal to work outside your city is not because you are looking for growth. It’s to get out of this marriage mania. You have no idea, what will happen next, but you sure don’t want marriage/relationship to be next. So you are running and running till someone hunts you down."

7,"What is the best advice your father ever gave you?
One day I had a fight with my Mom and shouted on her and didn’t had my lunch. I went out with my friends and had food. Later when I came back, I was hesitant to face my Mom so I went to my room and started watching TV.

Then my Dad came to me and asked why you didn’t had lunch today?

I said I had food with friends and don’t want to have food cooked by Mom as I had fought with her today.

He listened to what I said and started speaking. You know, I sometimes don’t like what your Mom says or what she does but have you seen me shouting at her or fighting with her.

I said No

He said, if you or me or your sister fight with your Mom then we can go out with our friends or colleagues and have food, chill out and come back whenever we want but have you ever thought of your Mom after you shout at her. She will sit there and think for the whole day why you shouted at her and she will not have food for the whole day. So think before you shout at her or fight with her, you have a whole world outside waiting to hangout with you but for her you, me and your sister is the world and when anyone of us shout at her then her whole world comes down. For you it’s just a matter of few seconds anger so if you can suppress it for sometime you can make her world happy.

I honestly try not to shout or fight with my Mom anytime after that or even if I fight with her I make sure I apologise as quickly as possible.

Let’s make our Mom’s world happy always…..

8,"What mistake do you regret the most?
#good_lesson
I fell in love with someone else’s Girlfriend and destroyed my career.

I was an engineering student (B.Tech ECE) from the top college of India. During the final tear of engineering, I was placed in a reputed software MNC as I have a lot of interest in the software industry rather than my own branch.

But I had backlogs, which I had to clear during my final semester exams. During the last few days of my last semester of my B. Tech, a girl came in my life. She was my junior. She told my friend that I was her crush. When my friend told me about that, I was extremely happy to hear that as no girl has ever said that before for me. After that incident, we began chatting on Whatsapp daily. I didn’t have that much attraction for her and I lied to her that she was also my only crush in the college and she believed it. But as the chatting continued day by day, I also developed an attraction for her.

Then one day, she proposed me and I accepted as this was the first time any girl have proposed me. Then, we began to meet in the college premises. But one day, I realized that all this was wrong because she already had a Boyfriend with whom she was in a serious relationship from the past three years. When I told her about that she said that she knew it, but now she had fallen in a true love with me. She told me that her relationship with her boyfriend was a compulsion or a constraint. But with me, she had understood the meaning of true love. I was very happy on listening to her.

Then one day, we went to visit a famous tomb in our city. I laid in her lap. She kissed on my forehead. I kissed on both of her cheeks. After some time, she kissed on my lips. I was shocked as what the hell had just happened. It was my first kiss. Suddenly, we noticed as her hostel time was near so we should leave. But before leaving, I grabbed her face and kissed her tightly. She got very emotional and began to cry. After coming to the college, I was serious and asked her that she had to choose between me and her boyfriend. She cried again and told me that she cannot leave him but she want to live with me in the future.

Only few days were left before starting of the final exams and I had to give three extra exams because of my backlogs. But, I was not at all serious for my studies because my mind was thinking nothing except that girl the whole day and night. We were always busy in talking to each other till the late night.

In daytime, we met in library and sat together for studying. But I was not able to study that much because of the strong force of attraction. I kissed her on lips many a times in the college library. I kissed her in the corridors of the college. I kissed her while hiding in the college premises. Then the exams arrived. Before the night of the exam, I was busy in talking with her on phone. She was crying all night as she always did. And I was giving the condolence along with studying. I didn’t sleep the whole night and was talking to her. The exam time was from 9 am. And I decided to at last turn off the phone conversation at 7:30 am after talking with her the whole night. A lot of money was wasted on phone calls and for buying the gifts for her.

After 2 weeks, the exams were over. We decided to go to a religious place near my college in the morning at 5 am. That place is an ancient large water tank, which is extremely sacred from many centuries. The intention was not to offer a prayer but to have a good intimate time where we could enjoy because in that early morning, at most 3 or 4 people were there in that large place. We went there and kissed each other for almost half an hour. We didn’t stop kissing while coming back on the empty road. It was like that we both were stroked by the arrow of Cupid.

When we came back to college, she went away with her friend for some time and left her mobile with me. I knew her app lock password and opened her Whatsapp in her absence. I read her chatting with her boyfriend. And after seeing that, I was totally shocked because the way she treated him was the same she treated me. The same romantic conversation, which we usually did was with her boyfriend. I felt as if she was cheating me and her boyfriend. Then, she left for her home and I was missing her and cried a lot in front of my friends.

I waved a final good-bye to my college and came back home. We both continued chatting on Whatsapp even after I knew that she was cheating with me. Then one day, I aggressively asked her about her final decision with whom she want to spent her life with. And she said, it would be none except her boyfriend. I was very angry and extremely sad at the same time.

Then after few days, my result came out and I was unable to clear my backlog exams and had got another backlog in the final semester. I was shocked and destroyed internally. I lost my job of Rs. 5 lakhs per annum. I gave around 30 off-campus interviews and was not selected despite clearing the interviews because of my backlogs. Then one day, finally I decided to accept whatever this destiny will give me. I joined an MNC who was giving me Rs. 12k/month for the Content Writer Profile.

And it has been 4 weeks now since I have joined…

These are the things I regret:

I lied to my parents for a girl.
I wasted a lot of my parents’ money for a girl, who is never mine.
I lost my job because of my insincere attitude.
I lost my mind and the capability to think what is right and what is wrong.
I am a failure in front of my friends who are earning around 5-10 times as I earn.
I cheated in many exams in my final semester due to lack of preparation.
I lost my honesty.
I lost my respect.
I lost my character.
Many of my friends made fun of my condition. Everyone treated me as a big fool because I lost my job.

My parents,

my best friends,

my relatives,

everyone…

criticized me..

But after these failures,

I decided to renew my life.

I decided to go back on the track on which I was running years before when I was a topper in my school.

I decided to become an honest person no matter what.

I decided not to cheat my parents again.

I decided not to fall in the matters of Love again.

I decided not to ruin my Life again…

I decided not to give up this time and rebuild myself…

I decided to do my best in whatever I do, be it a job of 12k/month…

And I am sure one day I will make my parents feel proud on me…‼!

10,"Q :- What are some interesting things about money that only a few people know about?

A :- Most of the people on this planet have no idea how much more wealthy a billionaire is, as compared to a millionaire.

If one dollar bills were stacked one on top of the other,
One million dollars would be 109 meter high, just a little higher than Taj Mahal.
One billion dollars would reach the thermosphere - the outler layer of earth’s atmosphere !

If one dollar bills were put end to end, in a straight line,
One million dollar line would be 160 kilometer long.
One billion dollar line would circle the earth 4 times!

If you decide to spend 1$ every second
To finish one million dollars, you would need about 12 days.
To finish one billion dollars, you would need 32 years!!!"

I laughed in his face and told him that my family disowned me and that I had sent a signed copy with a lipstick kiss on it to my father and his friends already. He is a very arrogant man and I knew it would make him livid and feel ashamed. I must admit when the guy brought the video and said I know your father I played along with him and pretended to be surprised so that when I revealed that I didn’t care a bit about what he did with it would make him embarrassed and I made sure the meeting which started out private became public. I was pretty cold then and enjoyed toying with him."

Last year, we were having a session at the University “Study skill’s module” ,when the professor gave us a sheet and asked us to read it carefully before we start filling it in. And added that the one who finishes first is the winner, so everybody was trying to be the winner. Although he insisted on reading the sheet accurately no body paid attention. After a while, someone said loudly ""Yes, i have"". And i was like no way how did he reach the 14th number,i don't wanna lose .. I was only in the number 11. Then another classmate said, hey wait it's a trap! everybody was asking how is that? .. the student asked us to go and read number 22. Oh gosh! we are all losers ..

The professor started laughing and said, you know what your problem is .. is that you don't listen! He justified that he played the game just to show us how it's important to focus on what is being said. And always remember to read the questions before you start answering them.

To be honest, it was the smartest thing ever!

This was an incident that took place almost seven to eight years back.

My brother was posted in Noida and for the first time was away from home.

One fine day, out of nowhere, he decided to Cook. He called us to inform.

Bro: Mom, I've arranged a cylinder and bought a stove. I will cook by myself now. I can't eat this canteen food anymore.

Mom: Very good beta(son). Good decision. That is not healthy as well. Carry on.

Bro: But I don't know how to cook. You guide me on phone and I'll follow.

Mom: Ok beta. First do one thing. Take some rice and rinse it thoroughly.

Bro: Wait! (After few minutes.) Okk mom. Done.

Mom: Good. Now transfer the rice into the cooker and pour ample amount of water.

Bro: Done.

Mom: Now close the lid of the cooker. Turn on the cylinder and place it on the stove.

Bro: Done.

Mom: Now wait for 3 to 4 whistles of the cooker and then turn it off.

Bro: Ok mom. Thank you.

(Cuts the call.)

Mom: Thank God! Akal toh aayi iss ladke mein. (Finally, this boy got some brains.)

Me: Yes mom.

(After almost 45 minutes, we again get a call from him.)

Bro: Maa! Abhi tak ek bhi whistle nai aayi. (Mom. There's not even a single whistle.)

Mom: Kyaa! Aisa kaise ho sakta hai? Tune cooker ka dhakkan toh lagaya thha na? (What! How can that be possible? You placed the lid?)

Bro: Yes mom!

Mom: Pani dala tha na? (You poured water?)

Bro: Yes mom!

Mom: Whistle lagaya thaa cooker pe? (Did you place the whistle on the cooker?)

Bro: Yes mom! That was already there.

Mom: Gadhe! Stove ON kia thha? (Idiot! Did you light the stove?)

22,"What are the bitter truths of life one should know?

No Body wants to hear this, But Sometimes the person you want most, is the person you are best without.

Do not think you are always a winner, even if you are winning all the time.

Do not be the enemy of your charioteer, your gatekeeper, your cook and your brother, they can harm you anytime.

Always trust the minister, who criticises you.

The day your friends stop bringing their problems to you is the day you have lost your best place in their hearts.

Lies don’t ends relationships. Usually the truth does.

Listen to people when they are angry because that is when the real truth comes.

You ever notice , People rather stop speaking to you rather than apologise when they are wrong.

These are some of my favourite sarcastic ones that I have used I don't know how many times.
When someone tries to offend you: I'm sorry, was I meant to be offended? The only thing offending me right now is your face.
When someone accuses you of being interested in their partner: I don't want your gf. Nobody wants your gf. That's why she is with you.
When someone says you're gay: I'm straighter than the pole you danced last night. (There's nothing wrong in being gay though. I don't understand why people try to make jokes on it.)
I don't know what makes you stupid, but it really works.
When someone tries to say something funny but fails: Almost funny. Almost (with the most serious face you can make).
I was going to give you a bad look, but I see you already have one.
If you put your face by a door, no one would ever come in.
When someone keeps pestering: If I throw a stick, will you leave?
Ugly or mask?
When you're busy and someone keeps interrupting: I'm busy right now. Can I ignore you some other time?
For the absolute a-holes: You are the reason God created mid finger.
There is only one problem with your face, it can be seen.
When someone won't stop talking: keep talking, someday you will say something intelligent.
It's kinda sad watching you attempt to fit your entire vocab into a sentence.
When someone says something utterly stupid: It's better to let someone think you're an idiot than open your mouth and prove it.

Talking about sarcasm, how can I not quote Chandler here: ""Are you really saying these words?""

That's all I have for now. Will add more if something good crosses my mind."

26,"What would you do if you found $500 in a parking lot?
.
.
.

When I was about 18 I found $100 in the street, and not another person was in sight. $100 was a heck of a lot of money then, and I have to confess that the idea of keeping it did cross my mind. But then I thought that perhaps it might belong to somebody poor who was desperately in need of it, so I dutifully trotted off to the local police station with it and told them I where I had found it, expecting them to pat me on the back, tell me I was a wonderful human being, and wave goodbye.

To my enormous surprise, and extreme discomfort, they immediately started grilling me about the circumstances. Were there any other people in the street? Were any people in nearby houses or gardens watching? Were there any possible witnesses in parked cars? And a lot of other questions along those lines, until I was seriously starting to feel like a criminal myself, and thinking if it ever happened again, no way was I ever going near a police station. It came to an end, and it turned out it was so rare for anyone to do this, that they thought that perhaps I had only done it because somebody had seen me find the money, and so didn’t feel safe keeping it.

Then I did genuinely get the pat on the back and the praise, and was told to tell my parents they should be proud of having such an honest child. But that wasn’t the happy end of the story.

That night there was a knock on our door, and a boy from our street was there. He had just completed his first year of university and done tremendously well. His proud grandparents, who were in fact quite poor and couldn’t really afford it, had sent him the money as a reward for all his hard work. He was sure it was lost for good, and only out of desperation went to the police station to see if somebody had handed it in because he couldn’t bear to tell his grandparents it was lost without trying. He literally had tears in his eyes, and couldn’t stop thanking me.

Would I do it again? In a heartbeat."

He won six consecutive olympic medals! Remember what Usain Bolt said? Win three and become immortal? Imagine six !

How did he become so strong?

He started his training by lifting a new born calf. Hah! So easy peasy. I can also lift a calf. You can also lift a calf. What's the point of lifting a tiny calf? Huh.

Where as his competitors attempted to lift a full grown up Bull instead. Yo. And they all laughed off the calf lifting. Who does that! Stupid Milo. Huh.

Milo carried the calf daily, all the time. The calf grew slowly and so did Milo's strength.

And ultimately Milo could lift a Bull effortlessly.

Whereas his smart ass competitors were still attempting. Sometimes succeding maybe, but not like Milo. Smart Milo.

Learn from Milo.

Buy a calf. Lift it daily.

You may sometimes keep it down, but never for long. Lift it again, and let it grow slowly.

One day you will be definitely able to lift a bull. All the best."

34,"Q :- Why do people do MBA after B.Tech?

A :- Last month (August, 2016) we had the privilege of meeting and interacting with Dr. Raghuram Rajan (yes, the rockstar, who also happened to be my boss till 7 days ago (4th Sept)).

At the open interactive session someone asked him exactly this question. Why do most Indians pursue MBA after BTech? (Rajan Sir had himself done that).

He first laughed and admitted that he too had to face that nagging question early on in his career.

The rest of the answer in his words:

“Somewhere in the third year I lost interest in engineering. It is then that I decided I would go for MBA. And after graduating from IIM-A I joined Tata Administrative Services. I was taken on a visit to a plant along with other recruits. There we had the plant in-charge cribbing that these engineering MBA grads have wasted an engineering seat etc, etc. A while later while we were moving up in an elevator, beside our elevator there was another shabby, dingy one. I asked the plant in-charge what or who that other elevator was meant for? He replied that it is for the engineers! (crowd bursts into laughter)

The point is, in India, the remuneration for an engineer is not at par with a manager and we still need more companies which would treat their engineers at par or better than their managerial counterparts. And that would happen if companies invest more in R&D and give more challenging roles to engineers in India. People move in a direction that is incentivized. However, no education is a waste.”

Rightly said, Sir."
35,"What is the biggest scam you’ve ever seen?
Carla Jelder

My best friend is a very wise and intelligent person . . . usually. One day I was at her house and I was talking to her as she was piling clothes into the washing machine. At the end she threw in what looked like plastic ball kinda like this:

When I asked about it, she said she saw it on an infomerical and this completely eliminates the need for laundry detergent. Apparently, these magical balls have ceramic beads inside that change the pH of your water so that dirt comes right out. Oh, and anti-bacterial properties to boot.

Uh huh. I could NOT believe she would fall for this but she swore that her clothes came out clean. “Of course they did — you washed them!” I said.

I just could NOT fathom how this plastic ball could do anything but no logic would intrude on her now-detergent-free-world. (Here’s some funny reading on it: Do laundry balls really work?)

Not too long ago, I was reading an article in the Wall Street Journal about the seismic shift that Tide had made in the laundry detergent industry with their pre-measured pods because people were using WAY, WAY, WAY too much of the liquid. Turns out, all you need is a teeny, tiny bit of detergent to do the job. An industry insider explained that it was shocking how much detergent people would use in a load as the formulas now are ultra concentrated but consumers were still pouring in as much as they were in the old days. You’d have to rinse your clothes five times just to get all the residue out, but of course, your washing machine only goes thru one rinse cycle.

He went on to say that he was surprised that no one had discovered the real secret: “Most of the time, you don’t need detergent at all. Just washing in plain water will get your clothes clean”.

Well, I guess the plastic washer ball inventor had their “a-ha!” moment. Knowing that people wouldn’t feel right about washing their clothes without something, they invented that “something” . . . a $1 plastic ball from China with some beads inside and a good story! These sell for $30, $40 and up, depending how good a story they can sell you on. They’re all over the internet and Amazon so people must be buying them. Yes, their clothes ARE getting clean, but the ball has nothing to do with it. Talk about the “placebo” effect!

Also funny: the makers claim how eco-friendly they are because they use no harsh chemicals (yes, because you’re washing your clothes in plain water) and they last for 1,000’s of loads (I guess they had to put a limit on it so you’d think they wear out and buy more!)

I sure wish I’d thought of this scam… harmless, but lucrative!

P.S. Don’t even get me started on the SNUGGIE! — a backwards robe that made $100 million dollars!"
36,"What are the most hilarious thing done by indians?

So I have something which along with being quite hilarious is also shows the presence of mind and strategic capabilities of Indians.

So the story goes like this:

In the mid 1960s, when the Indian Navy began to acquire equipment from Russia, there was hardly anyone within the service who knew the Russian language. That began to change as India ramped up its purchases of high-octane hardware from Russia. By 1970, dozens of Indian seamen, mainly those from the 25th Missile Squadron, were undergoing naval training in Vladivostok. This proved out to be a great decision as these seamen were to play an important part in upcoming war of 1971.

Now as soon as the war starts, the current PM indira Gandhi called the meeting of all the three service chiefs and told them to prepare for war, the Indian Navy’s Admiral S.M. Nanda requested clearance for an attack on the oil installations in Karachi. Since it was Pakistan’s main trading port, a successful attack would also ensure an economic blockade of Pakistan. The navy planned to hit Karachi on the very first day that Pakistan attacked India. Based on the success or failure of the first attack, more raids could then be launched.

The war Breaks out:

Pakistan Air Force jets attacked Indian airfields on the evening of December 3, 1971 and the Indian Navy decided to attack on the night of December 4. In order to inflict maximum damage and to confuse the enemy, the raid was to be coordinated with a strike by the Indian Air Force on Karachi harbour.

Petya frigates were to follow at a slower speed but stay not too far away from the rendezvous. Naval Headquarters and the HQ of the Western Naval Command were to listen in on Pakistani wireless circuits and pass the relevant intelligence to the attacking force.

Radio silence was critical during the mission but especially while approaching the harbour at night. This was because the Pakistanis had an advanced surveillance radar station gifted by the US under the Suparco defence treaty. If it spotted the Indian ships, the element of surprise would be lost.

Now here comes the play by indian navy.

A key – and unusual – advantage with the Indian Navy was the Osa crews’ fluency in the Russian language. Communication between the attacking vessels, Naval HQ at Mumbai and the IAF was extensively in Russian.

This was done to fool the Pakistani naval intelligence before the commencement, and during the attack. The enemy could not connect the chatter on the radio waves to any offensive sea movements by the Indian Navy.

In fact, Pakistani intelligence believed the radio chatter came from the Russian Navy’s detachment located further south in the Arabian Sea. They thought the Russians were manoeuvring in response to the US Navy’s movements in the region.

The Osas used their missiles with devastating impact in two separate raids. IAF aircraft returning from a diversionary raid on Masroor airbase described the fire as the “biggest bloody blaze in the whole of South Asia”. The fire was also seen from space by American astronauts on board Spacelab.

This was one of the many brilliant yet hilarious and simple trick used by indian forces to hoodwink the enemy and eviscerate them.

You must have got the Gist by now. We indian are hilarious when it comes to teach a lesson to our enemy and eviscerate them."
37,"What are some of the most interesting little-known things?
Madhan Kumar, Knowledge is everywhere!

A road in France, disappears twice a day!
Yes, you read it right!
Passage Du Gois is a road that connects the Gulf of Burnёf with the island of Noirmoutier in France.
Due to the rising tide, you can only drive along it for a few hours before it gets flooded.
The rest of the time it’s hidden 13 ft beneath the waves. In 1701, the natural passage connecting the mainland to the island of Noirmoutier was first indicated on a map.

Around 1840, a regular service began to be provided by car or on horseback. Today, the road is around 2.58 miles long.The seemingly ordinary road is in fact extremely dangerous. On both sides of the road there are special panels, which will tell you if the road is passable or not. And yet every year many adventurous travelers get trapped in the rapidly rising waters as the tide comes in.

For those caught between the tides, elevated rescue towers are located all along the Passage Du Gois. A person can climb these towers and wait until they are rescued or until the tide goes down again.

Worth the bucket list!"

I had crush on my best friend. She knows it from beginning that I like her. But she has a boyfriend, since I was aware of the fact that she is committed. So I always tried to suppress my feelings. Since we were in same college and her boyfriend was from her hometown, so we often meet during parties thrown by our seniors. Suddenly our meeting were getting frequent. We used to go outside alone. One day we went for shopping and while returning from mall we were alone in the auto. She was sitting just in front of me. I was constantly looking at her face. There was utter silence in the roads as well as in the auto. But out of no where she suddenly said”I think I also have some feelings for you.” I was dumbstruck that what she just said. Did she even know what she just said. She kept asking me that what should we do now until we reach college.I had no idea why did she said so since she was committed. I told her that I think about it and tell her tomorrow to what to do next. I reached hostel and received a message from her that whatever she said was a sin. I thought she shouldn’t have said that . So I’d decided to not to talk her anymore. I told her we can’t talk anymore because whatever she said was not good for three of us. Even it was hard for me not to talk my bestie. She tried a lot to save friendship but the damage was already done. I start ignoring her for sake of good of her, me and her boyfriend. Now it’s been 3 months she is happy with her boyfriend.

39,What is the deadliest thing ever?
40,"What are the main reasons why fast (military) jets can't fly all the way across large oceans and rely, instead, on being transported as air cargo?

Good question. Let’s take…. this one for example.

A-10 carried to Afghanistan on a C-5.

The distance between San Fransisco to Kabul is 11949 kilometres for example or somewhere around 7424.9 miles, that is way too much for A-10’s 1287 km range to go there directly as it requires a lot of refueling in air or in allied base. C-5 on the other hand has a range of 11705 km so if you want to transport it from say from somewhere around California to Kabul then it only requires 1 refueling instead of around 15 times the A-10 requires.

Sometimes you only need to transport a few aircraft and to send it the other way (land or naval) requires a massive effort as you need to escort and make a big convoy (land) or you only have big ships (naval) so for small amount of aircraft transported you can use aircrafts.

Aircraft reach the destination faster than ships. With the top speed of 932 km/h, the C-5 is way faster than any cargo ships that the US armed forces have so it is useful for fast transport to replace aircraft that is damaged or requires replacement for other reasons. And if it is transported by ship, the aircraft still need to be carried by land from the seaport to the airbase while if transported by the aircraft the package can go straight to the airbase."
41,"What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?

Krunal M Harne, Analyst in the office, Singer in bathroom, Philosopher near bus window.

Oh boy, this one is harsh. And let me tell you that, you are not gonna like it.

Yesterday, I watched Sully. It is based on the real life story of Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger who lands the damaged plane on Hudson river, miraculously saving all the 155 lives on board. He is charged for not landing on LaGuardia or Teterboro and for ‘risking’ the lives of the passengers and damaging the airplane.

He says, “42 years of successful landings, and they would still judge me for those 208 seconds.”

Did you catch it, yet?

Imagine he worked 5 days a week, 1 flight every day, and exclude the Christmas holidays too.

Number of successful landings = (5/7)*42*365*(11/12) = 10,037 flights
Number of passengers landed = 150*10,037 = 15,05,625

Before he was acquitted, they blamed him for those 208 stressful seconds where his reaction time was 35 seconds, and nobody actually gave a damn about his past record of landing more than 1.5 Million people safely. Even though, after landing, all he cared for was the count of “155”.

And here you have a very very harsh lesson to learn.

You can do 99 things for someone and all they'll remember is the one thing you didn't do.

Most people forget all the good that you did, and in the end only judge you for the bad, or rather what they perceive to be bad. Nobody cares about the good intent behind your actions. All they see is the final output. Simply because it’s easy to overlook the good, and remember the bad.

After a while, most people don’t give a damn about how much you have helped them. They take you for granted, because hey, you were just performing your duty or friendship. Just one bad thing, and they are all against you.

In personal life, be helpful without expecting too much from anyone. It’ll hurt you less. And if you are compromising on your comfort for helping anyone who isn’t worth it, then it’s time to think through and make a wise choice before it’s too late."

Satyen Rajpal, Student

This incident just happened today as soon as I saw this question, that scene just flashed by my mind. So, here goes.

I was at the Cafeteria at the place where I am doing my internship. I had already ordered something to quiet the growls from my stomach before my friend(Let’s call him D) arrived. He came in 2 mins after I took a seat.

After careful scrutiny of the half erased menu, he half heartedly decided to have a Dosa, again. He handed over a 100 Rupees note to the cashier for a 30 Rupees Dosa expecting Rs 70 back but the cashier did not have sufficient change and requested to take the Rs 70 later on to which he agreed.

After satisfying our hunger, we approached the cashier for the change to which he said that ‘D’ did not give any money and demanded that he pay the charge for the Dosa. We argued with the cashier that we had given Rs 100 and you asked us to take Rs 70 later, the cashier refused any such agreement being made.

‘D’ said that if he can proves that he has given Rs 100, we would want a free Pepsi can and our change back. Over-confident, the cashier agreed. To my astonishment, he remembered the last 4 digits of the note he had handed over to the cashier! Astounded, the cashier searched his drawer and found that same note with Gandhiji smiling right at him. Pepsi never tasted that good before!

I got to know later that he has a peculiar habit of memorizing the last 4 or 5 digits of all the 100, 500 and 1000 denomination notes in his wallet. Smart? An understatement!"

How can I schedule a phone call with a billionaire?

As a twenty-one year old social entrepreneur who'd just moved to San Francisco with zero money or connections, I realized that if I ever wanted to achieve my dreams I needed advice from people who have been there and done that. 

So I did the most naive thing anyone could think of: I wrote to captains of industry - Presidents and C level executives of Fortune 500 companies. I let them know that I admired specific work decisions they'd made and character traits they'd displayed publicly, and it would be amazing if I could learn from them. 

I should have known better, right? These were the busiest people on the planet, and who was I to think that they'd respond to a twenty-one year old kid with absolutely zero recognizable talents (beyond, perhaps, the ability to write an email?) and offer their mentorship?

Then the unthinkable happened. I received an email back... and another one... and another. Over the next few years, I found myself learning from and mentored by people like the President of Morgan Stanley, the President of NBC, the CMO of Coca Cola, the CMO of Intuit, and more (I'll spare names to save the unsolicited emails)...

I never understood why.... 

Then one day, we'd all gotten together for a board meeting for one of my companies and someone joked that he'd gotten to know me through a cold email I'd sent him. The room went silent. Then, one by one, everyone around the table acknowledged that he, too, met me through a simple, cold email. 

Laughter. 

The President of NBC spoke up. ""Do you know why I decided to meet with you Daniel...."" 

I didn't know. 

""Because in 20 years in this business, every single person who reached out to me cold wanted something. They wanted money, a job, something. You were the first person who asked - only - for advice.""

Q:- How can I become a better looking guy?

A:-  
1.) Remove the scars and paleness of sorrows and anger and enmity and anxiety by applying creams of Smile, Cheerfulness and eternal silence.

2.)Take regular baths in your own sweat by working for others selflessly.

3.)Wear clean clothes (not necessarily new fancy ones). It should be free from dirt of corruption, crime or any misdeed. As rightly said : “ A stain on your cloth is a blotch on your image”.

4.)Know how to behave while among better looking girls. Don’t give jaw dropping faces or absurd remarks. The most important thing to learn is to mind your eyes. People, especially women notice your eye movements well and can tell about you without even talking with you.

5.) To look better forge 8 of these elite abs with regular practice and workouts:

*)PATIENCE: Develop your""PATIENCE"".

*)MANLY MANNERS: One should know how to behave with people(kids-grown ups, rich-poor, strangers-family all different types of people)

*)DECENT LANGUAGE: Believe me ,how one speaks influences more than how one looks. Looks evade, talks persists.

*)SWEETNESS: Etiquette's should never be ignored. Saying Please,Thank You more often makes you different in a group of people.

*)CALMNESS: Everyone likes a person who converse well but at times one should know the importance of calmness.

*)STRONG MORALS: Have your own sets of strong morals. It can be learned from our parents,friends and by observing other great personalities.

*)RATIONAL THINKING: One should agree to disagree and respect other people's opinion.

*)LOYALTY: Every better person sticks by his word and stays true to what he believes in.

5.) Last but not the least, as said by the late President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, “I am not a handsome guy, but I can give my hand-to-some one who needs help. Beauty is in heart not in face”. One can be a better looking person(not by face but by character, behavior). Everyone will look at you with great respect, honor and admiration, better than how they look at better looking guys(by face)."

Modi will become P.M said 'prophetic' Dhirubhai Ambani in early 1990s. 
Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani on Saturday was just one of many prominent public figures who wished Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his birthday.

But Ambani's message was special. For in it, he revealed something his father - legendary industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani - once said about the PM.

""Lambi race no ghodo chhe. Leader chche,"" Ambani senior had said according to his younger son. The translation: ""He's a thoroughbred for the long run. A true leader!""

Anil Ambani says his father had invited Modi home in the early 1990s, several years before he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. Once Modi had left after having a ""long, intense conversation"" with the Reliance founder, the latter had remarked that Modi would one day become the Prime Minister, Anil wrote in his message.

""As ever, Papa was simple, direct - and prophetic!"" he said.

Calling PM Modi's election to the highest office in the Union government ""a defining moment"" in India's history, Anil Ambani wrote: ""Papa would have been smiling in heaven that his prophecy as usual had come true.""

Dhirubhai Ambani's estimation of PM Modi's personality is perhaps best summed up by another, rather more poetic, quote that Anil attributed to him. ""In the words of my father, Narendrabhai ""dreams with his eyes open"" and with Arjuna like clarity and purpose,"" he said.

Q:- Should I marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past?

Answer by:- Rahul Raj

A:- Look at the diagram in the picture. 

There is one voltage source (you), a capacitor (she) and a resistance in series (problems in your way). Initially, the capacitor may be charged or uncharged i.e., the girl might have had boyfriends in the past. Let’s assume that the capacitor is plugged in the circuit now i.e., she is in your life now. Let me tell you that the final steady state voltage across the capacitor will not depend on whether it was initially charged or not. It only depends on the applied voltage (you). The time to achieve that steady state might differ depending on the history of the capacitor. Likewise, it doesn't matter whether she had a boyfriend in past or not. All that matters is your effort to make her happy and make her your dream girl. It may take a bit longer time but eventually you two will gel with each other nicely. So, it shouldn't matter whether she had a past or not. Go ahead!

Edit 1: One of the comment depicts the other side as well. Vaniambadi Natarajan writes, “but then if she keeps thinking about her ex boy friend, that is similar to another battery having opposite polarity to the capacitor. Your battery will just get drained. And she may not get fully charged to light your bulb. In that case, you are better off with a new capacitor.”"

A friend of mine had a conversation on this with me. He was complaining that the police were corrupt and always asking him bribes. I was surprised as I was never stopped randomly for bribes.

In 5 seconds, the policeman tested and let me go. Since I was driving at 1am in the night [the flight got late] he had a reason to ask for that test. I was happy he was doing his job and moved on to my destination. And I was not stopped for anything else in the recent years.

I’m not saying the policeman are all honest, upright individuals. But, they are not any more corrupt than you. Before complaining about the police, do a quick introspection in the mirror - are you following the rules correctly? If you are not wearing the right helmet, not wearing the seatbelt, not stopping at the signal, not carrying the correct insurance, you are the problem.

Again, when you are caught for not wearing the helmet and pay Rs. 100 instead of the actual fine, you are not the victim of corruption, but the one corrupting the system."

68,"Psychological hack.

A few months back, I observed this at a vegetable market nearby.

Vendor A (shouting): Pyaaz 100 rupey kilo...
(i.e. onions, Rs. 100 per kg)

Vendor B (shouting): Pyaaz, 25 rupey paav
(i.e. onions, Rs. 25 per 250g)

And vendor B had far more customers at his counter than A.

But Why ?

Basically, our buying decision is very much price sensitive. The first thing that grab brain's attention is price and then we make all other analysis.

Its a widely used psychological selling technique which we generally don't notice.

71,"Everyone knows that there is dispute going between Karnataka and Tamilnadu regarding Cauvery river.

Do you know why, it started suddenly ?

Just go through this answer written by Balaji Viswananthan.

Karnataka has the following arguments on the Cauvery issue:

1) The initial agreement made between Madras state and Mysore kingdom nearly a century ago has already lapsed. That agreement had Madras with upper hand [a key province under the Raj] and Karnataka wants to renegotiate that with more water for itself.

2) Although Tamil Nadu has a larger share of the Cauvery basin, in terms of population the two Kaveri regions are comparable. The biggest two cities of Karnataka - Bangalore and Mysore are dependent on Kaveri water, while the top 3 cities of Tamil Nadu are not dependent on Kaveri river. Karnataka wants 50% of the Kaveri water, while for most of history most of the water went to the delta.

3) Karnataka needs Kaveri water for drinking water purposes, while for Tamil Nadu the need is more for food production. Karnataka’s argument is that food production can be altered a bit [by reducing 3 crops per year to 2] in water scarce years while drinking water consumption cannot be easily altered.

4) Karnataka gets the monsoon earlier in the year compared to Tamil Nadu. The former argues that Tamil Nadu could get Northeast monsoon later in the year even if the Southwest monsoon earlier in the year fails.

5) The Kaveri basin of Karnataka is far more drought prone than the Kaveri basin of Tamil Nadu. Unlike other regions of Karnataka it gets less rains and is more dependent on the river water.

Tamil Nadu too has equally strong arguments making it tough for Supreme Court to clearly rule something that would make both parties happy. Neither side wants to hear the other’s side and think through just theirs. Again, it is much easier for the governments to blame the other side for their own water mismanagement. If the two governments seriously cared about the water and people, they would be strenuously cleaning up the lakes, desilting water bodies, go after illegal sand mafia wrecking the river beds, encourage water conserving crops and so on."
72,"Q:- What is that one moment in your life when you felt "" I am awesome"" ?

A:- I saved a life from suicide when the whole colony was just watching.

This happened in S.G palya,Bangalore . I was moving from jayanagar to SG palya( near forum) and I just finished shifting things.

Around 10pm, I was reaching my new place and I hear someone crying from the groundfloor. I opened the gate to see the whole colony just watching from outside.

Suddenly a small girl around 6 years age comes near me crying and says “Uncle Uncle , my father my father… “. Initially I thought perhaps the father hit the child, but then I see that her father had locked one of the door from inside. I see her mother trying to bang the door as hard as possible but in vain. With full force I bang the door and with three attempts the door opens and I see her father hanging himself and some white liquid( kinda mucous ) in his mouth.I used all my power to catch him and released the saree which he used for hanging. His wife thanked me and even fell on my feet. I was shocked to see that I was able to help save a Life.

Later I came to know that he had hanged himself just because of some small fights regarding purchase of new mobile.

I gave a sarcastic smile to all the people who were watching this from their respective homes and went back to my room.

I was not able to sleep that whole night.I felt so awesome.

And If god gives me the opportunity to save more, I will gladly help without even thinking twice."

76,"Q :- What is the connection between computer science and algorithms?

Answered by Thomas Cormen, co-author of Introduction to Algorithms, considered as bible for CS grads.

I’ll tell you a little story. A true story.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, I worked at a startup that made systems for computer-aided design. Users could define parts and store them in a library of parts. Each part could include another part by reference, so that if you changed the definition of a part, then all of its uses would update automatically. Part A could include a reference to part B, which could include a reference to part C, and so on. Circular references were not allowed, as a part could not include itself.

We had a customer that wanted the library of parts written out to tape so that each part appeared on the tape before any other part that used it. I was the only person at the company who knew that what this customer wanted was a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph. I knew that there was an efficient algorithm for this problem, and I knew where I’d seen it (in Knuth). I didn’t remember the details of the algorithm, and so I went to the library, got a copy of Knuth, and implemented the algorithm.

People at the company thought I was a god for knowing how to solve the problem, and how to solve it efficiently.

That’s why you want to know about algorithms."

81,"I am one of those guys who never gawk at women. In fact, I am so discrete most of the times that my previous two girlfriends actually pointed the 'fact' out that I don't check out girls.

Honestly speaking, I do check out women.

I'll tell you about something that happened a couple of days ago.

I was travelling in the Delhi metro alone. 
Now most of the times when I'm alone, I immerse myself in music. This time was an exception and I just stood there observing people around me.

There was this girl standing not more than 10 feet away from me. She was one of the most beautiful people I've ever laid eyes upon. I couldn't tell much about how she was as a person (obvious), but she was physically attractive and possessed a bewitching personality.

I definitely checked her out.

What I didn't do was:

Gawk at her with my mouth wide open, making her and/or other people around uncomfortable.
Change my position to go stand near her.
Invade her privacy in any way.
Make any obscene gesture to render her (and me) embarassed.
When she got down a couple of stations before me, I didn't follow her going off my own route.

In fact, I pen down all of the above things just because I'm answering a question and trying to make my point.
In that moment, I didn't think to myself ""I shouldn't go and stand near her. That would be wrong"" or ""I shouldn't stare at her like an animal.""

In that moment, it was all instinctive. I couldn't fathom invading her privacy.

It's been 48 hours since that incident and I'm positive I won't be able to recognize her if we happen to meet sometime in the future.

Checking out and ogling at someone are two different things.

Similarly,

Checking out and objectifying women are two different things as well.

I don't get attracted towards just the physical aspects of a stranger. 

Sometimes, I see a girl reading a book in the metro and I instantly separate her from the rest. (especially if it's a book I like)
Sometimes, someone's attire is what sets her apart from the rest of the group for me.
It's not always the physical aspects of a girl that grab my attention. 

There is absolutely no problem in 'checking' people out. Eveyone should just know their boundaries.

The two golden rules for checking out are:

Don't invade someone's privacy.
Don't make them feel uncomfortable.

I personally wouldn't mind if I catch a person looking at me, as long as they don't make me feel violated.

Same should be the case with women. If you expect me to look down at my shoes everytime a woman passes in front of me, then that's not gonna happen.
Call it patriarchy, call it misogyny, call it anti-feminism, call it anything you want.
I will observe people when in a public sphere and it would include the occasional thought to myself, ""Hey, that girl was really attractive.""

I don't find anything wrong with it, morally or legally."

85,"This post is dedicated to Aaron Swartz..(Part 3/3)

Three years later, that manifesto would be used against him. While a research associate at Harvard University in 2011, he went to MIT and downloaded 4.8 million scientific articles from the online academic library JSTOR. Though Swartz's account was legal, such mass downloads were a violation of JSTOR's terms of service.

Swartz had previously attracted FBI suspicion back in 2009, when he used a Perl script at a Chicago library to share nearly 20 million court records that were being sold over the internet by a government agency. The records were legally free to access, so the FBI was powerless to stop him, but they didn't forget the humiliation. While biking home from MIT after his JSTOR stunt, Swartz was arrested and later charged with 4 felonies. As the New York Times reported it: ""a respected Harvard researcher who also is an Internet folk hero has been arrested in Boston on charges related to computer hacking, which are based on allegations that he downloaded articles that he was entitled to get free.""

Did Swartz plan to share the articles he downloaded? His manifesto was used as evidence of intent by prosecutors, but those who knew him say he planned to analyze the documents for evidence of corruption. Regardless, the only actual impact of his ""crime"" was that for a few days, JSTOR blocked MIT's access. JSTOR declined to prosecute Swartz, and MIT's network and facilities were readily accessible by design.

During 2011 Swartz -- already facing multiple charges of computer and wire fraud -- launched a new activist group and led victorious campaigns against SOPA and PIPA, two pieces of legislation that would have crippled internet freedom. Evidently he had not learned his lesson.

In 2012, the government increased the charges against him to 13. His legal defenders were still optimistic. When he was offered a plea bargain including a mere 6 months in prison, they refused. But by August, the case had sucked away all his money and Swartz was reduced to begging his allies for financial support.

On 9 January 2013, JSTOR announced that a large portion of its journals would now be open access. But for Swartz, it was too late. He was facing up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines after years of persecution by the US government. His counter-offer to government prosecutors had just been refused. With no end to the torment in sight, on 11 January Swartz hanged himself.

He was 26 years old. He paid for his crime with his life. That heinous, unforgivable crime of possibly having intended to provide public access to scientific research that was now mostly open access anyway."
86,"This post is dedicated to Aaron Swartz..(Part 2/3)

His manifesto from 2008 .

Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. 

There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. 
Everything up until now will have been lost. 

That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal — there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. 

Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. 

Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. 

But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. 

Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. 

There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. 

We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. 

With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

At 8:46 a.m. on the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 struck World Trade Center Tower 1, (The North Tower). Rescorla heard the explosion and saw the tower burning from his office window in the 44th floor of World Trade Center Tower 2 (The South Tower). When a Port Authority announcement came over the P.A. system urging people to stay at their desks, Rescorla ignored the announcement, grabbed his bullhorn, walkie-talkie and cell phone, and began systematically ordering Morgan Stanley employees to evacuate, including the 1,000 employees in WTC 5. He directed people down a stairwell from the 44th floor, continuing to calm employees after the building lurched violently following the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 38 floors above into Tower 2 at 9:03 AM. 

In Between Rescorla called his wife, telling her, ""Stop crying. I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I've never been happier. You made my life."" 

After successfully evacuating most of Morgan Stanley's 2,687 employees, he went back into the building.When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, ""As soon as I make sure everyone else is out"".

He was last seen on the 10th floor, heading upward, shortly before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M. His remains were never found. Rescorla was declared dead three weeks after the attacks.

So, there was this chapter called carbon. My mind was blown when I heard diamond was also carbon. The left over mind blew away when I heard, coal under the influence of high temperature and pressure changes to diamond.

My spotless mind connected the dots and came to a conclusion that, if pieces of coal are placed in a pressure cooker and heated long enough, will change to diamonds.

I had this idea all time. I waited for summer vacation to begin.

My aunt used to visit us during vacations. Her son(my cousin) was also my age. His mind blew up as well when I told him my plan. He looked at me with admiration, as if I’m some sort of spiritual healer. Even I considered myself as a highly intellectual being for my remarkable discovery.

We teamed up. Our maid arranged some coal blocks for us. We already had pressure cooker.

The next day my aunt and my mom went out to buy some household stuff. Dad in office. Just me and my cousin.

The time was ripe. Let’s do it.

I chose our garage for this historic event. I created a small stove with bricks. My cousin placed 3 - 4 large coal chunks in a bowl and placed the bowl in the cooker. He then poured some water circling the bowl. (Water vapor will build up pressure inside).

I removed the whistle and tightly sealed the hole with m-seal and other things (very bad idea). AND THEN the sorcery began.

Double, double, toil and trouble.

We made fire with the left over coal. After making few small adjustments, we sat on the ground few feet away from the stove. Now the waiting game . I knew how to begin the experiment, but, had no idea how to end. (Abhimanyu and cousin in chakravyuh ).

It was almost 15 mins now, the cooker was super hot. Occasional fisss sound could be heard. The rising water inside created that sound, I suppose. Few more minutes. Now the fiss sound was all over. FISSSS FIS FISSS FISSS.

Somehow, we were excited. The more the noise the bigger the diamond, I thought.

The noise got louder. This time all sorts of noise, as if a dozen crackers are inside. And then, the cooker jumped few inches off the stove and fell on ground. We sprung up and as we were running away, the cooker exploded.
The lid stuck on the side wall. The bottom part, hit the other wall and created a massive dent(dent would be an understatement). It was coal and water all over and no diamond. sigh.

You can imagine what might have happened to us that night when our parents got back home. Hasta la vista, baby. Don’t try this at home or garage or anywhere else.

.
.

I'm marrying a woman;

Who was physically and emotionally abused by her parents and two elder sisters

Who was molested by her brother-in-law and when she told her parents, they asked her to not to say anything about it. They however keep them apart ever since.

She went abroad for a scholarship while we were friends during graduation. She was dating someone and she never told me about him. He got her pregnant and she had to undergo a very uncomfortable abortion. When she returned the guy called it off because he couldn't do long distance relationship.

Her parents got her married forcefully while I was pursuing post-graduation. She got divorced 1 year later.

After her divorce she fell into severe depression. Her nervous system was deteriorating because of her severe depression, anxiety and panic attacks.

Her parents forced her to work and earn money ignoring her weak mental condition.

She's an extremely fragile and emotional person. She is gorgeous and stylish. Too many men flirt with her, but she turns them down politely. She dresses appropriately.

She jumped into a blazing building to save 3 adults whom she never knew. She rescues snakes. She fought off men beating a woman.

She speaks 5 international languages fluently. An excellent orator. A gold medalist lawyer.

She writes amazing poems on love, society and humor.
I love her. I lost a lot of myself in the journey, but it was all worth it.

I helped her out of her depression, anxiety, nervousness completely.

My parents don't know any of the above, because if they did they would never give their blessings for our marriage.

But I'm proud of myself. And more than that I believe in her and love her to eternity.

113,"What was the most magical moment of your life?

.
.

When Facebook paid me $5000.

Those people who say “Money can’t buy happiness” are dead wrong.

I did my 12th on scholarship. Got 65% marks in 12th and failed to qualify IIT-JEE and AIEEE. Dropped a year to prepare on my own, was not able to afford the extra financial pressure of coaching . Next year result was better but not good enough to get admission in government colleges.

My father said “we can’t afford engineering, join the local college for B.Sc”.

That was tough for me, I contacted few private college and got to know I can get admission on my present rank and 12th marks.

But “Where’s the money ?” dad asked.

“Give me 25K , that’ll confirm the admission and then we’ll talk to banks for education loan” I replied.

“I earn 8k per month, 25k is big deal but don’t worry I’ll ask my boss if he could help” dad replied.

Next day he borrowed 25k from his boss, asked one of his friend to convert that in DD (demand draft) . I got the DD by 5 PM and next day took a general ticket to Delhi.

I got the admission and later with little struggle got the loan as well.

From the 1st day there was this extra pressure of loan.

Somewhere in second year I came to know about this term Bug bounty program , where big company pay for reporting security issues in their website. It took me almost a year to learn in and out of security, meanwhile I got a cheap laptop.

And one Sunday afternoon I reported few security bugs to Facebook (notes and message).

Monday evening I got a mail from Facebook and Bang !

I was not able to sleep that night. $5000 (3 lakh) was a big deal, I had never seen that much amount in my account or even in my dad’s account.

Next day I took the day off from classes to calm down but one of my teacher called and asked me to come (It was all over my Facebook).

I made a guest appearance for 5 minute with a copy of W-8BEN form in my hand. (Someone clicked this pic ), whole class congratulated.

Next day it was in newspaper

After this I never stopped, I became financially independent. Paid my education loan that year, got clients from all over the world, contributed to security of 500+ websites.

Now Ranked #62 (worldwide) on Google bug bounty program > Vulnerability Reward Program

Made my first million in college and got covered by national/international newspapers and blogs."
114,"Why is reading so important?

Imagine a room within four brick walls.It's comfortable and you have what you need. 

But it has no windows.

This room is an ordinary life. Acceptable, but limited. 

Reading is like creating a window.A window means a breeze. It means light, and the sun shining in, and a view.

The view can be anything, anything you want. A beach, the sky, a story, history; soldiers ready to raise the alarm, a boy in a cabin, a beautiful woman with a long yellow dress, a tiger, desperate and hungry, trapped on a life raft. 

You can look out at whatever you wish; and you can learn. Pick what you want to learn about: the entirety of world knowledge is at your fingertips.

The more you read the more you open windows in the brick walls until you are left with no bricks. Just a vast expanse full of everything you have chosen."

124,"5 things that you should do in your 20's. 

1. Build a foundation for health.
In your twenties it's easy to feel like you're invincible. That fast food and the five margaritas you downed the night before burn right off and you wake up the next morning feeling fine. This does not last. Start building healthy habits now before they catch up to you later. At 30, I'm still struggling with this one myself. Get in the habit of eating healthfully and exercising. Your body will thank you for years later. 

2. Learn resiliency.
Your twenties is a time when most are relatively free of the responsibilities that will increase into your thirties and forties. This is a great time to experiment, fail, and bounce back. Learn how to ride out failure and persevere. Life is full of challenges. The twenties are a great time to toughen up and start teaching yourself how to be emotionally and mentally resilient enough to weather both the joys and hardships to come.

3. Figure out what lifestyle and career work for the real you. 
I felt like a failure throughout my twenties because most of my university friends seemed happy in corporate jobs that made me miserable. I felt constant pressure to fit a specific mold. It's only within the past year that I've started to come to terms with who I really am and what really makes me happy. Life is not one-size-fits-all. Choose the career and lifestyle that are true to you, not a version of you that you wish you were. 

4. Learn to live within your means. 
This point is a related one to the financial advice Jason shares in his answer. Learn smart financial management now. Learn how to live within a budget and maintain good credit. A mistake I once made, and one I still see a number of my peers making, is being a slave to lifestyle: taking cabs everywhere, buying expensive clothing, and having meals out constantly. This is stupid and reckless. I know people who were left completely adrift despite having made great salaries because they had no savings when their careers hit a rough patch. Their income was spent all on things that are frivolous. Luxuries are a wonderful thing only if you can truly afford them. Don't be a slave to funding a lifestyle that will not last. Learn to live modestly and save up, and then you will have earned the right to purchase yourself some treats, in moderation. 

5. Choose who you spend your time with carefully.
Time is a precious commodity and you start to realize that increasingly into your mid to late twenties. Choose your friends wisely. Separate yourself from toxic or negative influences, those who would waste your time, and those who encourage you to focus on the unimportant. Seek out people who give you happiness, who inspire you, who support you, and nourish those relationships instead."
125,"one of the most honest answer::

What opinion do IIM students have of Chetan Bhagat?

There are only two legitimate reasons to ""hate"" Chetan Bhagat.
You're a literature student
You're jealous

Give the guy some credit. 
He wrote his first two novels while working as an investment banker (and any IIM-A alumnus will tell you that it is a very demanding job)
He has written 6 books till now - all being best-sellers
4 of his books have been adapted into movies - 2 (3 Idiots and Kai Po Che) have been blockbuster hits, one (Hello) was crappy and one (2 States) is still in production.

Yes, he is not a writer of the highest quality. 
He is definitely not in the league of Shakespeare, Dickens, Tolkien, Wodehouse and King. Hell, he is not even in the second league of Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon and Micheal Crichton. 
He is a ""mass-writer"". His works are comparable to 50 Shades of Grey, The Twilight Saga, Justin Bieber. He is, what you could call, a Masala artist - he writes for the masses.

Not everybody can be a Tolkien, and nor should they. A majority of the Indian population, would not be able to appreciate Shakespeare's works because they are simply not learned enough. 
Not everybody can appreciate the lyrics of Bohemian Rhapsody and the beautifully executed ballad and the brilliant guitar solo. Some people need  a Flo Rida or Pitbull to make music that they can groove to when in a club.

In short, there will always be a wide spectrum of writers, with appeal to various segments of the consumer market. Chetan Bhagat appeals to the majority of Indian youth by virtue of his simplistic writing and his choice of subjects (college life, love life etc). Also, as Akash Sarawgi pointed out, he has spawned a generation of readers. People started out by reading his books as they were the ""in-thing"" while in school and college, and then slowly developed reading as an hobby.

As an IIMA student, I do not hate him, or hate when my institute is associated with him (Hell, it was his institute before it was mine). He has achieved more than I have, and I have no right to judge him.

We had a university ruling that if the the professor didn't arrive after 15 minutes from the time the bell rang, we can leave class. We entered the classroom and there's a blackboard note of the name of the professor, the class code, and the class schedule.

The professor was nowhere to be found. The professor had a funny last name so my classmates who arrived earlier made fun of the professor's name.

Upon entering the class, there's a handsome buff guy scribbling notes  at the back row. I am not a shy person so I sat next to him and introduced myself. He said his name was ""Dan"". I asked about his major, his schedule, anything to get to know him and to kill time.

When I ran out of questions, I ranted that the professor was a bloke and joined with the rest making fun of the professor's name. Dan laughed with us and even initiated more jokes about the professor.

at the 14th minute everyone was looking at their watches and doing their countdown. At the last 20 seconds, ""Dan,"" stood up from his chair, walked toward the blackboard, and said, ""OK, CLASS.""

Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

Want to hear a story which made this quotation true ? 
Here it is - The Best Real Life Motivational Story – Károly Takács

In 1938, 28 yrs old Karoly Takacs of the Hungarian Army, was the top 25 meter rapid fire pistol shooter in the world. He won most of the major national and international championships. He was expected to win the gold in the 1940 Olympic games. Those expectations vanished one terrible day just months before the Olympics. A hand grenade exploded in Károly’s right hand, his shooting hand at an Army training session. That hand grenade ended up destroying his shooting hand and his Olympic dream.

After spending a month in hospital, he decided not to feel pity for himself for the rest of his life. He held on to his Olympic dream. He had the will, he had the attitude, he had the determination to succeed, and he figured he had a healthy, fully functional hand. He decided to practice shooting from his left hand. Despite the fact that he was not left handed, he focused on his goal and practised. To achieve anything worthy in life one needs attitude and will. Skills and techniques can be learned, can be taught, but not will. He chose not dwell in the world of facts, he chose to explore the world of possibilities. He was determined to make his left hand the best shooting hand in the world.

For months Takacs practised by himself. No one knew what he was doing. Maybe he didn't want to subject himself to people who most certainly would have discouraged him from his rekindled dream. In the spring of 1939 he showed up at the Hungarian National Pistol Shooting Championship. Other shooters approached Takacs to give him their condolences and to congratulate him on having the strength to come watch them shoot. They were surprised when he said, “I didn't come to watch, I came to compete.” They were even more surprised when Takacs won!

The 1940 and 1944 Olympics were cancelled because of World War II. But Takacs kept training and in 1948 he qualified for the London Olympics. At the age of 38, Takacs won the Gold Medal by beating the then reigning world champion and setting a new world record. Four years later, Takacs won the Gold Medal again at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics.

Prakash Iyer mentioned in his book The Habit of winning “Winning a gold medal in Olympic is less about the hand, more about the mind. Life is like that. Winning is less about skills, more about attitude“."

This will be fun! Ok, we were honeymooning in Langkawi at the Barjaya Resorts. One afternoon (post lunch luxuries!), when we were trying to get our ‘act’ together, this happened - Imagine two honeymooner’s dressed nude, and trying their luck on fancy positions. The resort room had a balcony, with a big window. We had not latched the window but it was very well tucked together and closed. In middle of our gymnastics, we heard the window door open, and a grown up, big sized monkey enter in. We were, as you can imagine - TERRIFIED! He gazed at us, and in a much composed manner - walked to the side table where some food items lay. He picked up an apple, and started eating it. I regained my senses and realized I was supposed to ‘do’ something about the situation. So there was in a nude avatar, just out of the complicated position - hustling away the monkey! It did go away - jumping through the bed, lending a final blow to my wife’s shocked state! Phew! A wild honeymoon afternoon - not the way you might want “wild” to be treated as, but well, literally!

I later learned that monkeys were a regular in that resort rooms, and so guests were asked to latch the windows all the time.

A:- Here are some interesting random facts,

1) You're completely blind for about 40 mins a day. When your eyes move, your brain purposely blocks your vision, which is why you can't see the motion of your own eyes in a mirror. It's called Saccadic masking, and without it your life would be like watching a constant movie that's filmed with a shaky, handheld camera.

2) If you feel strongly that someone is watching you, they probably are. Your brain has a primal ""gaze detection"" system that determines whether someone is staring directly at you, or looking a few degrees to the left or right of you, which gives you a 'feeling' of being watched.

3) There is a persistent storm in Venezuela that produces lightning 140 to 160 nights a year, 10 hours per day and up to 280 times per hour and it's been going since at least the 16th Century.

4) Colonel Sanders got fired from a dozen jobs; was a lawyer who once assaulted his own client in court; started a restaurant that when went out of business and found himself broke at the age of 65; That's when he started KFC.

5) Masha, a stray cat in Russia, kept a 2-month old abandoned baby boy warm in freezing temperatures before being found. The baby survived.

6) A Woman in Oregon started a wildfire to give some work to her bored firefighter friends. Eventually, the fire, name as the Sunnyside Turnoff wildfire, spread to about 80 square miles - 51,000 acres - costing nearly $8 million to fight and took two months to bring under complete control.

7) An island, located between Australia and New Caledonia, was charted on maps for over a century until a crew of scientists sailed to the location and found it didn't exist.

8) In 1914, British WWI soldier Thomas Hughes tossed a beer bottle with a letter to his wife into the English Channel. He was killed two days later. In 1999, a fisherman dredged up the bottle in the River Thames. Although Hughes' wife had died in 1979, it was delivered to his 86-year old daughter.

9) The fastest red card in soccer history was 2 seconds. Lee Todd was sent off for foul language after he exclaimed ""Fuck me that was loud"" after the starting whistle.

10) Liam Neeson used to be a teacher, but got fired for punching a 15-year-old boy when the boy pulled a knife out in class."
147,"What is the loveliest thing a child has ever said to you?

Richard Muller's Answer 

""Would you like one, Grandpa?""

OK -- it was not my child but my 3-year-old granddaughter, but I still think it counts.

I had read about the marshmallow test. You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you'll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). 

According to extensive experiments, children who ""pass"" the ""marshmallow test"" are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome.

She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate.  I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That's when she looked up at me and asked, ""Would you like one, Grandpa?""

Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her."

Now for people who can relate, this is a tricky situation for men.  When you are making out and you need to get rid of her clothes immediately, you need to be spot on or the moment passes.  And if it's followed by her laughing, the mood dies along with it.

So I was frantically kissing and searching her back for the bra clasp when she tapped my shoulder and we broke our kiss (sadly!).  She then told me, how the clasp was sometimes in the front too.  She laughed, I smiled.  I deleted the memory taking a mental note for future reference.

But do things end for girls with the situation?  NO!!

Cut forward to scene two, her friend's b'day party: a house party with all her friends (around 20 of them with their boyfriends/dates).  I was to get up, open the door to take the pizza but I couldn't figure out how that door unlatched.

I was still searching the latch when the b'day girl said,  ""sometimes the latch is in the front too!""

The flashback was immediate, in my head.  When I turned, all 20 of her friends were laughing with a look which meant they knew it all.

I confirmed from my gf later, they did know it all, all 20 of them.  Unlucky me!

So yes, girls talk!"

151,"What did someone do that made you think they were really smart?

My friend once did this:

He was at his grandparents' place for some days. His cell phone with internet was his only companion whenever he felt bored. He used to go to the terrace before the dusk and it became regular after he saw a girl of his age 3-4 terraces away. There was no direct possible way to approach her. Then what he did was what I think is a very smart move. He noticed that the girl after coming to her terrace would take out her mobile and then stick to it. He also figured out that she was using some WiFi to access Internet. He came up with this idea. He created a WiFi hotspot with a name like "" hello pink top"". It took some time but soon after she got it & understood what he wants. She then created her own hotspot with the name ""98********-save it"". That was direct. I think she was smart & he was lucky. They dated for months after that and are now good friends. But I think only few people utilize technology in such a subtle way."
152,"What is the best interview question ever?

A: (I: Interviewer, C: Candidate)

I: You feel exhausted after so much waiting, have some water. (Pointing towards the bottle kept in front)

C: (Extends his hand towards the water bottle)

I: Wait ! That cap's mine, you can't touch that.

C: ?? (Blank face)

I: Yes, you have to drink it without touching the cap of the bottle.

C: (Holds the bottle in his hand, and after looking for a while, put it back on the table) There is no water in the bottle, Sir !

I: What are you saying, can't you see, it is full up to the brim.

C: (Calmly) No sir, I have checked and I couldn't find any water there.

(Interviewer keep on saying that there is water while showing him bottle repeatedly, but candidate was reluctant to accept). You can't wake up a man pretending to sleep.

Finally after few minutes of 'water is', 'no water'.

I: (completely frustrated, opens the bottle and started pouring it in front of C) What is this then ?

C:

(Snatched the bottle from his hand and drank it all and after taking a long breath) Thank you very much Sir !"
153,"What is the one skill that,if you have it,will completely  change your life?

A:- Perseverance.

I could offer countless stories of people who have succeeded in life because they had that skill. But I won’t.

For example, I could have told you about J.K. Rowling, a broke, divorced mother who bashed out the first Harry Potter story on an old manual typewriter, and had her manuscript rejected by 12 publishers before being accepted by one who nevertheless warned her there was no money in children’s books. 

But I won’t.

I could have told you about Ethiopian Abebe Bikila, son of a shepherd, who won back-to-back Olympic marathons in the Sixties, became a quadriplegic after a car accident, and returned to international sports as an archer.

But I won’t.

I could have told you about Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson or comedian Wayne Brady, both of whom had serious stuttering problems as children and used the stage as a way to overcome them.

But I won’t.

I could have told you about Nick Vujicic, born without arms and legs, but whose motivational speeches attract stadium-sized crowds and give hope to those living with disabilities.

But I won’t.

Instead, I’ll tell you to take a good, close look at your own life and the challenges that came up along the way.

Of the time when you were five, and the simple act of tying your shoelaces made you frustrated. When you eventually figured it out, it wasn’t because you were talented. It was because you persisted (or your parents encouraged you to) until you got it right.

Or the time you were in school and had to learn a new language, and it seemed unthinkable you would ever be able to speak it with any degree of fluency. But you stuck with it, and you did.

Or the time you fell in love and thought the girl or guy of your dreams might be impossible to get. But you wooed them anyway, and you did.

Or the time when the love ran out and the relationship appeared to be drifting aimlessly, until you consciously decided to work on making things better. And they did.

Or the time you continued to send out job applications, despite the sinking feeling that came with every rejection letter or no letter at all. Until one company called you in. 

Or the time you started work at a new place and had this horrid feeling you’d be shown up as a fake because you had no clue of what needed to be done. Until you figured it all out.

Or the time you tried to get started in a business of your own, and kept failing at it, until you found a way to steady the ship and power ahead.

Or the time you decided to take up something new, like woodworking or web coding, and you couldn’t but be disheartened at how hard it was. But you persevered, and now looking back, it surprises you at how far you’ve come.

Talent is a nice thing to have. It’ll take you far. But to get to where you really want to, that takes perseverance."
154,"What's the bravest thing that you have ever done ?

A :- This incident happened few weeks ago. I am a Journalist by profession. While I was travelling back home from office in the local bus, I was standing near the driver’s seat. I noticed an old woman (in her mid 50’s) dressed in old saree and was looking more like a maid or a beggar. She was carrying a small child with her who was in deep sleep. When I saw the kid’s face, he looked about 2 years old, fair colored, wearing clothes as if he belonged to some well-off family while on the other hand, the woman didn't look like his family.

At first, I tried ignoring it but then I gathered all my courage and asked her in a firm voice ‘ye bacha tuhmara hai’ (is this kid yours?) . She gave me a confused look and said, “No, it's my daughter’s kid.”

I then asked where is her daughter to which she pointed at some back seat which I couldn’t see as the bus was already very crowded. I then stayed quiet for few minutes and without she noticing, I pinched the kid to see if he is really sleeping or if he is unconscious with some medicine. To my wonder, I found that even after pinching several times, the kid didn’t respond by crying or by waking up.

I was sure that she is a child thief and informed the driver and conductor about it. The driver was somehow smart enough and stopped the bus midway and he asked the woman about the child and his mother. She got nervous and tried escaping but she couldn’t. We then informed the police who then arrested her and investigated about the child and finally after some days of struggle and visits to the police station, the officers found the real family of the kid who belonged to Gurgaon.

I felt proud that I could help somebody."
155,"What is the most embarrassing thing your family (parents or siblings) has said to your crush?

This thing happened with me recently. My younger brother and I went to watch the movie Dilwale.

The movie had a scene in which Varun Dhawan (the younger brother) tries to defend the relation between him and his girlfriend Kriti Sanon (pretending to be just friends) in front of his elder brother Shahrukh Khan with the help of a dialogue ""Bhaiyya, it's just casual hi-hello"".

After the movie ended my crush bumped into me (coincidentally she had also come to watch the same movie).

She - Hi.

Me - Hi, what are you doing here? (Oops, poor start, embarrassed already)

She - Well I guess you know it (smiles). Btw is he your brother?

Me (introducing her to my brother) - She's my friend. She also studies in Pune.

My brother- ""Voi hi-hello wala scene hai kya"" (translation- Same hi hello scenario?)

Me (embarrassed but trying to handle the situation while giving a tap on his head)-""Bada bhai main hoon naa ki tu?"" (translation-""Who is the elder brother? Me or you?"")

Brother -""Heroine kaunsi Kriti Sanon hai?""(translation -As if the girl is as pretty as Kriti Sanon"")

Me:

""Don't pay attention to him. He says things without thinking.""

1. For an aspirin to save your life during a heart attack, You need to chew it. Because aspirin works faster when it is chewed. A small amount is all you need and since time is of the essence, chewing delivers the anti platelet effects through the blood vessels in your mouth instead of the digestive process.

159,"What should every Indian know about USA?

If you’re new here, driving a car and you get pulled over by police, DO NOT come out of the car. Remain in the car, seated, relaxed, and put your hands on top of the steering wheel, 10:10 clock position and wait for the cop to come to you. Do not do anything suspicious like bending down to get something. Make the officer feel comfortable (that you’re not trying to attack him or drawing a weapon from under your seat or glove box) and everything will be smooth.

This doesn’t come naturally to us because we generally tend to pull over and move out of the car toward the officer. DO NOT do that in US. This can avert unnecessary trouble."

 Biology Test

During Class 10, there was a class test in biology subject on chapter “Reproduction In Living Organisms”. He was dictating all the ques to us.

Our biology sir asked “Kyun abhi test ke beech me kyun jana hai” (Why do you want to go to washroom in the middle of a test). I, out of over-excitement, shouted, “Sir, yeh diagram copy karne ja raha hai” (Sir, he is going to copy the diagram)

161,"Q:- I am a 19 year old guy. How can I become a billionaire in the next 10 years?

A:- Passion !! Passion !! and Passion !!

Find your passion and let it kill you, and you will surely turn out to be successful someday. Earning billions on your success is a secondary thing though.Unless its your passion you will stop doing it at the next big hurdle you face. When its the only thing you want to do, you keep on trying until you succeed. Some might get lucky and succeed at the first attempt and some might have to try a thousand times, but as long as you're working on your passion you will be happy.

162,"Question: How is Reliance Jio going to make money?

Answer:
Which plan would you choose? If you are a voice-only kind of person, then you would be okay with the Rs 149 per 28 days plan, as you will get free unlimited voice calls. But, even though you are not explicitly paying for voice, you are already paying over Rs 150 per month, thus their ARPU will by default be as good as the current players.

If you are someone who uses over Rs 150 worth of voice calls every month then it is a totally awesome plan for you. But, my point is that other telecom companies make about Rs 150 per month on average from each user by charging for voice, SMS, data and roaming. Jio will be making the same/more amount of money on average from each user even after providing SMS, roaming and voice calls for free, by just pricing things differently.

Now, if you are a moderately data using person, which plan would you choose? Did you see that there is no plan in-between the Rs 149 and Rs 499 plans? This is basically a psychological trick to get you into the Rs 499 plan. Many people will compare it with the smaller plan and see that you are getting Unlimited 4G night data and choose atleast the 499 plan.

They do have some smaller plans at Rs 19, 199 and 299, but these plans do not really offer any more value than their main plans as they have even less validity. Also, it offers less data per rupee. For example the 299 plan only offers 21 day validity and 2GB data. This may be adequate for many people, but if you ever exceed the 2GB limit, then you will have to purchase ‘addon packs’ and these addon pack will have the validity of the main pack. So, if you recharge on day 20 of this plan, then you will get only one day validity for the addon. For practical purposes, you will be spending more for lesser value through these packs. The Rs19 pack maybe useful for those who want to use some internet & voice calling once in a while.

Now, again see that if you want to really use more than 4GB of 4G, then you have to spend double and move to the 999 plan. Did you notice that there is nothing in-between?

Also, notice that all these plans are for 28 days which can easily be perceived as ‘a month’ by most people. If we divide the number of days in an year with 28, we will realize that we are paying for 13 ‘billable months’ in an year. (365/28=13.03)

163,"What are the most embarrassing moments in life?
Most embarrassing moment converted into sweet and romantic love story.

The story started in class XI. I am an introvert and shy person from small town 
Extremely sorry for length!!!joined a big school and one of the coaching center in one of the metropolitan city for my preparation for IIT-JEE . So one my first day of my school i am quite nervous as i have never to been to such sophisticated school. When i reached my class i find one girl is beating and scolding one boy in the corridor. For me it is hell lot to swallow as any girl is beating and abusing a boy as my background always teaches me that girl never do such kind of things.Though i tried to cross the corridor ignoring the fight but as i reached the place where fighting going on i stopped as some kind of element is stopping me there .That element is beauty of that girl. She is the most beautiful girl i came across in my life.She is too sweet and adorable. I forget where i am and watching the girl from head to toe and my eyes meets her and that second i fall in love with her and in the next second she pushes me me and asked me what i am looking,i nodded nothing and went inside my class. Then i find out she is my classmate in school and coaching too and feels like the luckiest man alive. Everyday i watch her in the class and do not have courage to convey my feeling after watching what happened on the first day at school.

Fast Forward…..

There is no interaction between us in whole two years of schooling. On the last day of school during the farewell when everyone is promising other we will be in contact in future and wishing good luck for upcoming board exam and JEE exam we came in front of each other. She wished me luck and congratulated me for success in sports(badminton won inter school and played state championship) in two years at that time i know that she noticed me and i am someone for her she knew. We talked around ten minutes and bid farewell and good luck to one another and shook hand. I even remembered that touch.That was the best ten minutes of my life.

Fast Forward….

Result of IIT JEE was declared i can not cleared iit but i cleared AIEEE(at that time for admission in NIT we have separate exam that is AIEEE).I don’t know about her result as i came back to my native place. Then i got admission in NIT and joined institute for fresh start in my life and remembering her as my best memories of my life. On the first day of college i am full of confidence and pride of an NITian and went to attend to class. When i am searching for my class room in one of the corridors of the building i heard someone is calling my name from behind. First i thought there will be some other person with my name as no one knows me in that college as none of my friend admitted to that college then i turned back and see a girl in pink churidar running towards me and she no other than my dream girl.I felt i am in dream and no one is around except us. Then she pinched me and i come back to reality and she told me that she is in cs branch and i am in mech. I felt bad why i do not opt for cs.Then i know about sliding which happens after first year of college on the basis of seat availability and performance of student. Then i went to office to know is there any seat vacant in cs branch and yes!! there is one seat available.I spent whole one year studying to get slided to cs branch and in this mean time we became good friends,we spent maximum time with each other ,we play together(she is good badminton player which i came to know in college),we eat together in canteen and go out for shopping.After first year i topped in college and easily get one seat in cs and now we are together .In second year we came even closer we became best friends but i am her friend i want to be more than just friend ,i don’t have courage to express my feeling due to that incident of school. That incident have blocked my mind and i fear that i will loose her forever. So, i never expressed my feeling to her. Whole college thought that we are in a relationship. After second year we have a group of friends with whom we spent most of our time.

Here comes most embarrassing moment——-

One day she is not well so she can not come to class and told me to make proxy for her attendance. During lunch i do not go out of class as she is not there and also our next class is last class of the day.During lunch my gang(my group of friends) asked what’s in between us i told them our whole story and one sided love of mine.Then after class i called her she did not pick my phone nor replying to my text on any means possible. I called her roommate and ask her to give phone to her.But even she don’t talk to me. I don’t know what happened with her. I can not sleep whole night. Then next day she is not present in first two class and when third class started professor is taking attendance she come to entrance of class, now my mind is filled with question which i will ask her. Then she without seeking permission from faculty get inside the class come to my seat and i stand up to give her seat,then she slapped me and start scolding me in front of whole class.I see tears in her eyes during that time . I was dumbstruck , my legs are shivering,i don’t understand what is happening and after that she left the class.There is a pin drop silence in class even professor is in shock.For the next two days i am the topic of discussion in whole college.Everyone is making fun of me. I am receiving abuses ,jokes on me,memes. I tried calling her but she is not picking up calls.Then after two days her room mate called me and told me what happened.One of my friend who has crush on her manipulated my story which i told them during lunch so that his line can be clear.Then on third day i see her in canteen with the same boy and this time blood rushed through my veins and beast that boy and hold her and took her to garden and asked what’s the matter .She told me what poison that boy has told her.I told her what’s the real story and expresses my feeling to her.But she left without telling anything.I thought my world shattered there and i feel my life has nothing.I threw my phone to the pond in near by pond in the garden and spent night in the garden.Then in morning i left college and go to near by hotel and paid 15 days money locked myself in one room and no one knows where i am and no one can contact me .In 10 days i have not come out of the room. On 11th day hotel manager called police as he is suspicion on me.I lost 5 kg weight. Then police come to ask me who i am and what’s the matter.I told them everything and they consoled me and one lady officer in police station convinced me not to waste my life and start fresh. I thought of starting fresh and thinking of my parents i came back to college and told my parents whole thing.On 13th days i go to class with long beards and looking like i am ill.Then again i saw her in class she is also not looking good.I took my seat without making eye contact with her.I can hear murmuring sound in class after my entrance.I know they are talking about me .I kept my face on my bag on the desk.Then i felt someone is calling me by pinching me.I saw that person is no other than her.She is standing beside me then i also stood up and she kissed me in front of whole class. what she kissed me!!!

Then i came to know that after that day in garden she came to know the truth and she is searching for me to express her love for me.

Now that’s is my two most embarrassing moment of my life .

165,Have you ever made up a new word?? tell us about it in the comments..!!
166,"Q:-What are the secrets of being likeable?

A:- I learned the secrets of being likeable from a waitress named Debbie.

I was working in a high end restaurant as a cocktail waitress. The place was known for its steaks and was a hot spot for business men. The lunch crowd was made up mostly of suits and ties; a lot of powerful guys who wore nice watches and who all had sort of a new car scent about them.

The tip potential from a single shift was huge. Most of us were young, broke waitresses; we quickly got to know the customers and could spot the big spenders the minute they walked through the door.

You basically had one shot at gaining a customer’s loyalty; from the time they sat down until they paid their bill was your chance to make a big impression. If you did it right, they would reward you with a great tip and choose your section again in the future.

It was high stakes peacocking.

We would each try to be the most requested server. We were required to wear black skirts and white shirts, so we would make subtle improvements to our uniforms in the way of shorter hemlines, tighter shirts and push-up bras; the whole idea was to get noticed.

We would be charming, and would try different approaches to get them to like us.

Most of us were great at getting first timers to sit in our section, but for some reason they didn't become regulars. In this type of an environment, regulars are everything.

This was the case for everyone except Debbie.

Debbie was a money maker, big time. I had heard about her during my training period. The server I was shadowing told me the fastest way to get fired is by messing with Debbie.

I had heard stories about her. Customers would forfeit available tables in other sections and wait at the bar until something opened up in her area. She had most of the big spending customers as her regulars. The bartenders and staff loved her; she was the queen of the kingdom.

I finally met her two weeks into my job, and she was not what I had expected.

I had imagined her to be this super model look alike with a tiara practically welded to her head. Going off of her incredible reviews, I had drawn her very differently in my mind.

She was from Tennessee. She had long wavy brownish hair that she pulled back into a messy pony tail. She wore no makeup, had on a regular length black skirt and an oversized men's button down white shirt. She was not what I had expected.

She was the girl next door.

So what was it about her that connected so powerfully with everyone? It wasn't her looks or her sex appeal; Debbie's magic was her people skills.

I studied her. Seriously, I watched her like an educational film. I wanted to learn her secret. I paid attention to her body language, listened to her tone of voice and dissected her interactions with the customers. I asked people why they liked her so much, and I was able to piece together the anatomy of her social gift.

.1.She was easy. She didn't need anything in the way of approval from anyone. She didn't have any expectations of people. She maintained her own self esteem.

2. She let you be you. You didn't have to edit yourself around her or apologize for your opinions. You could talk to her openly about anything.

3.She heard you. There's a big difference between listening and hearing. She had the ability to interpret what you were trying to say, and understand where you were coming from.

4.She refused to trash others, ever.

5.She cleaned up her messes. If she made a mistake, she owned it.

6.She was comfortable in her own skin. This was a big part of her charm. She liked who she was, felt good about herself.

7.She was warm. Debbie was like the sun; she was warm and welcoming. People would feel good being around her.

8. She had no expectations. She didn't do anything with an agenda. She didn't manipulate people or situations.

9.She was real. She wasn't trying to be anyone or anything; she came as she was.

10.She liked people and understood human nature. Debbie would often say you can't have a beautiful garden without fertilizer. She knew that people could be ugly and give you crap in life, but the key was not letting it make you hard or bitter. Whatever was thrown at her in life was added to her garden and made her more beautiful as a person.

Debbie was popular because she was real.

She was honest; everything about her was hers. She didn't alter herself to impress anyone. She didn't need validation. Being around her was effortless; she didn't need your constant approval, she didn't bring along drama and she accepted you exactly as you were.

She required zero maintenance.

There are so many copies and fakes in the world; people want the genuine article. It doesn't matter how shiny a piece of glass is; when you put it next to a diamond it loses its luster.

I learned you can't create who you are and try to pass it off as an original; at best you'll be a good forgery.

Debbie was the real deal; she was the diamond."
167,"Q:- What single change in your daily routine had the biggest impact in your life?

A:- Adopting the two minute rule.

If something takes less than two minutes, do it now and then. Don’t give yourself room for decision making.

Our brain is very bad at decision making, because decisions introduce change, and our instincts are to avoid changes. The two minute rule is so awesome because it takes the decision making out of the way and forces a start on something you would have otherwise procrastinated on.

How the two minute rule helped me:

No more leftover dishes. Cleaning the dishes takes <2min

Clean room. When I come back home, it takes <30sec to get my clothes off and put them in the closet. 

Responding to emails. Ooh, this one is a biggie - we’ve all had times when we receive messages and we fap around for hours trying to find the best way to respond to them. I’ve forced myself to respond to non-critical emails and messages the second I see them, using succinct language. Works wonders!

De-cluttering my mind. New bill arrived? Pay for it. Idea for a holiday? Do the booking now. Appointment for the dentist? Make the phone call already.

Life is so much easier when you don’t have a huge list of chores that you need to remember."
168,"Ques: As a teacher, what is the harshest truth a student has ever taught you?

Ans. It was my first year teaching.

It was Grade 1 and in the middle of the semester a student had transferred from a different school. This child had major issues and I made it a point to work with this student and turn him around. For 6 months I dedicated myself to this child. I went out of my way to differentiate the learning for him, support him emotionally and showered him with love.

One day we were having an informal session and doing some arts and crafts. The new student went over with scissors and completely destroyed another students work. I must have been up late and lost it with this student. I yelled at him and gave him some punishment. He didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. It was Friday with a long weekend ahead.

I was so upset with myself. On my drive home I kept thinking of how I had blown it. How all my efforts to harness the positive energy in this child will now be lost. I resolved to apologize to him on the next day back at school.

Later that evening the doorbell rang and standing at my front door was my dear student with his mother. I was sure that she was going to give me a good telling off but instead the boy reached out and said ""we baked this for you...have a good weekend."" I thanked them very much and wished them a pleasant break.

There was an envelope on top of the cake. I opened it and read the following words.

Ans. My three year old and I were lying in bed together talking:

She: Dad, does everyone die?

Me: Yes.

She: Does that mean I'm going to die?

Me: Yes, but not for many, many years in the future after you've had a full life.

Then a long pause after which she continued.

She: Are you going to die?

Me: Yes, one day.

She: Dad, it's ok if I die but I don't want you to die.

I started crying at this point and had no words. She seemed so wise beyond her years.

172,"Will the BJP win in the UP assembly elections in 2017?
(1.3k+ upvotes)

I have recently visited Varanasi and had visited Kanpur last year for college fests and being a political addict, it's my habit to interact with locals about the political scenario.

These are the things I observed which was common:

There is a massive anti-incumbency against the current SP government. Water, electricity and other basic amenities have been poorly managed and hooliganism is at its peak.

Mayawati is highly respected! As shocking as it may sound, she is not remembered because of her freebies to dalits but because of her 'prashasan'(governance). As an outsider to UP, I was pleasantly surprised to know that people thought that Mayawati had done a great job in reducing red-tapism.

I asked them about the money she spent on building her statues and their answer was quite simple. ""In my village, she built a beautiful garden where we can hold marriages and other functions. We don't mind if there is her statue inside it. We don't care how much she spent on the statue. We are happy that now our village has a place where we can do so many things.""

Modi factor: When I visited Assi ghat last month, honestly it wasn't a great sight from cleanliness perspective but what shocked me more was when the locals told me that this was the cleanest Assi ghat has ever been! They attribute it to Modi and highly respect him.

Whenever I mentioned that I was from Gujarat, I was told how lucky we were(people of Gujarat) to have a CM like Modi for so long. I was surprised that many of the locals were not just impressed by his social initiatives but also by his foreign policy! I mean these people(shop owners, rickshwalas, watchmen)were in touch with current affairs more than an average college student.

No one talks about congress. It has become a non-entity in UP politics.

So overall the fight would be be between BJP and BSP and it would be very close. If the recent surveys are to be believed, BSP has an edge. Also there would be no Bihar like grand alliance since Mayawati is clearly in control and doesn't need any other party's support. SP and congress might stick together for survival but would be barely of any significance.

I would like to mention a very  interesting conversation with the rickshaw-vale-bhaiya of Banaras which went like this:

Me: Aur bhaiya akhilesh ji ki sarkar kaisi chal rahi hai.

R: (Waving his hand) Gai gai sarkar. Ye sab sadak dekh rahe hona(the roads were horrible). Kal 4 ghante bijli kaat di thi, parso paani nahi a rha tha. Isse achha to Mayawati thi. Ye police vaale bhi paisa nai mangte the unke shasan me.

Me: Fir kyu vote kiye SP ko?

R: Yahan ke log pagal hai. Yaha 70% log nasha karte hai, unmese 90% log sirf nasha karte hai. Election ke 1 din pehle yaha daaru ki nadiya behti hai aur log 5 saal ka kaam bhul jaate hai.

All in all, UP politics is complicated, influenced not just by caste and governance but also by liquor flux :p"
173,"What's the nicest thing you've ever done that backfired?
.
.
.

I am a Pediatrician. A Lot of things happen in a doctor’s life. This is one of many incidents. I would not say that it had backfired, but that had a huge impact on me.

One day, 10 year kid who was HIV positive admitted in our hospital. He has been positive since birth as his parents were HIV positive. The kid was in the last stage with a very high Viral load. That high viral load in the last stage of AIDS makes him very highly infectious.

I was a 1st year resident doctor in Pediatrics back then. The schedule was hectic as hell. I used to take bath every 15–20 days, and shave every 2–3 months back then. I have lost 21 kgs weight during first 6 months of residency. No phone calls, no family, no home, no entertainment, no songs, no movies, no music. I used to sleep (3–4 hours at max) in the ward itself and literally never came out of the hospital in that 1st year.

I was taking care of that patient and also another 50 very sick kids. When I was trying to insert IV line in his hand, that Intravenous catheter fallen on my leg and I got a needle stick injury. My Senior rushed me to the infectious disease specialist. I was put on 4 ART (drugs for AIDS) for next 28 days.

Now here I am… 23rd year of my life… who has spent his whole life securing more than 90 percent of marks… sacrificed all possible entertainment in my adult life… never smoked… never touched alcohol… did nothing wrong to anyone… And I was on the verge of becoming HIV reactive. I had to go through the HIV test at 3 months and 6 months after that incident. If those tests come normal, then only I am 100% sure that I have not got infected… Those 6 months was like hell…

I continued working in a hospital… I continued treating that same patient… When that patient was out of danger and somewhat stabilized, I filled his discharge card.

And finally the D day arrived. Both reports came Normal after 6 months. I was so happy. I donated my blood after one month.

Yes, We are doctors… We may get infected while treating you… HIV… TB… Swine flu… H1N1… and many more… When people scared to death to even come close to you… We welcome you… We treat you… We put ourselves in danger… Not for money… But to bring you back to life…!

No one is rich enough to pay us. We put our life’s hard and intelligent work to treat you. How much can you pay me if I save your kid’s life???"
174,"What are the common traits of highly intelligent people?

.

Stare more at the walls than people.

Imagination never leaves them. Without imagination, they are nothing.

Leave the group when they find people in them incompatible to them.

Generally polite, mature, good knowledge about philosophy of life.

Find uncomfortable to follow the rules.

Struggle a lot in their work. That is what gives them happiness.

Lot of self-respect for themselves.

In silence, they are always happy and peaceful.

All they need is love. That can attract them strongly.

176,"Q- What is the best random advice given to you?

A- 9 slapped 8.

8 asked, ""Why did you slap me""?

9 replied, ""You are inferior to me, so I slapped you.""

Upon hearing this, 8 went to 7 and slapped 7 harder.

When asked by 7 why,  8 gave the same reply that 9 gave.

""You are inferior to me"".

Likewise,

7 slapped 6.
6 slapped 5.
5 slapped 4.
4 slapped 3.
3 slapped 2.
2 slapped 1.

Now 1 has 0 as its inferior.

But, instead of slapping—

1 welcomed 0 with love. Allowed 0 to stand next to it.

The duo became 10.
 
Tables turned and It is now number 9's turn to get slapped.

Advice:

Choose your relations wisely.
A good friend is as worthy as 1000 good books.
A bad friend is as harmful as 1000 enemies.

For us love and friendship are different but equal. 

If some guy is taking out time and putting in effort for you doesn't necessarily mean that he wants you to be more than a friend. 

Guys tend to go out of their way to help their friends very often. Please don't take advantage of that.

Also, if some guy does the following things for a girl, it doesn't mean he is hitting on her. 
We do this for our male friends too, only in a different manner.

* Asks you to go out for dinner
* Pay the bill
* Tell you he had an awesome time
---
* Cover some 1000 kilometers just to meet you
* Give you a card
* Tell you he will miss you
---
* Calls you after a long time and asks to catch up
* Keeps ego aside and apologizes even if it wasn't his mistake
* Fight anyone and everyone who hurt you.

We value friendship more than you think. And it's almost never about getting into your pants."

I failed 57 times and it was only 58th time when I got a correct solution to it.
The joy was inevitable.
Later, I thought about it, was it worth giving 7 hours? Failing 57 times?

190,"#KarmaWins  #MustRead

Well this is a really cool incident that happened with me while I was travelling in the DTC bus. I boarded the bus to go to my college but all the seats were taken. Since only two people were standing (which is very rare as normally people are stuffed into the bus), so I kept standing.

I saw an old man sitting in one of the seats reserved for women. By the way the old man seemed to be from a good background and I thought of asking him to get up but then I decided against. I’m fine standing being an 18 year young girl!

So after a few stops another girl boarded the bus and asked the old man to get up. He had a big bag with him which seemed quite heavy so he was reluctant to get up but he was preparing to leave his seat. I was not happy with that so I told her she can’t do that.

Me: He’s an elderly man you should not ask him to get up.

Her: This seat is for women. Senior citizen’s have their own reserved seats.

Me: Yes, I know and you’re right but ethics call for it -_- You can’t ask an old man to get up in a moving bus. Surely you can stand.

Old man mean while was asking us to not argue and was getting up. But I told him not to and me and the other girl continued arguing, while everyone watched this little show. We reached the next stop and a seat in front got vacant. Suddenly she stopped yelling and pushed me aside and went to sit there. Next,

The old man then stood up and smiled at me warmly and asked me to sit on his seat. I thought he would be getting off on the next stop so I sat. He walked frailly to where that girl was sitting and tapped on her bag.

Old man: Get up, young lady.

Her: What? Why?

Old man: This seat is reserved for senior citizens!

I know none of us was an angel. The girl was technically right and I feel totally evil to laugh out loud and I don’t even know where Karma plays in but this was a pretty good experience I wanted to share."
191,What are the Most Amazing photos you have ever taken?
192,"What are some life hacks for a person preparing for a life determining exam like the JEE or UPSC?

Answer by:- Roman Saini. IAS (Rank 18) and AIIMS New Delhi Graduate.

Most of you reading this will not like the answer but to heck with it, I will write it anyway. Most of the toppers interview you read will be all flowery and optimistic. If you want that kind of answer, you have come to the wrong place. However, if you really wanna know what will provide you the highest probability of being successful, then congratulations and read ahead.

Life hacks will be extremely helpful in achieving target 2. To maximise your chance of getting selected and to increase your probability of getting through in first attempt, you should follow this:

Everything relating to daily chores like bathing, brushing, eating, and all that is needed to run your machine, should not be given more than 2 hours. If it is exceeding this time limit, cut down on bathing (bathing daily is a very recent phenomenon in human history occupying just last 300 years), eat small meals while studying (don't have huge meal sitting in front of telly or PC, watching movie or a TV series).

Switch off your cell phone while studying. People give logic that they talk only for 5-10 minutes, but our brain remain distracted even after the call is long cut. Especially if you're talking to a significant other, the 5 minutes have a tendency to turn into 50 minutes, that too 3-4 times a day.

Exercise for half an hour. You may pump iron in the gym, though it certainly is not at all a necessity. Rather do brisk walking, running, yoga, meditation, pranayama etc. It will help in creation of new neuronal connection and memory formation with improved retention period.

Avoid getting into a new relationship. Your mind is wired to feel extreme joy in such a situation and those oxytocin shots that your brain receives while being in love certainly make it extremely difficult to focus or to study. This was the best case scenario. God forbid (but will not) that it goes south, then you will encounter the true hell containing  countless hours of nagging, bitching, checking out their fb profiles, staring at last seen status on what's app, cursing yourself of starting it in the first place, constantly resolving of never calling or messaging them again, yet doing it within next 5 minutes; all this depletes your will power and then, your attempt is gone down the gutter.

Cut down on your social circle, especially  those who are not as motivated as you are in achieving the success in that particular examination.

Avoid attending marriages, social functions. They are all complete and utter waste of time. And if you are dropping a year, your family members will interrogate you with questions regarding your marriage, what do you want to do with your life, it is impossible to get 'selected' and rest of that BS.

Solve previous year questions, get an idea of what is being asked, and then read smartly from relevant materials only.

It is extremely difficult to focus for a long time. I personally get distracted every 10 minutes with thoughts of being world saviour, next big thing, a trillionaire, marrying Taylor Swift, and the very next thought of becoming a complete loser, good for nothing, failing miserably in the exam and then facing constant nagging from every corner of the society. The only way out of this is to either attend coaching classes regularly, watch some online videos regarding preparation and studying with least distractions around.

Always have a piece of paper where you have written your reason as to why you want to clear this exam. The myriad reasons which people have for clearing competitive exams range from money, fame, power, stardom, impressing someone (trust me it is there), helping others, childhood dream, nation building, getting better marriage prospects with huge dowry, proving worthy of being a son/daughter to their parents, parents compulsion, for the sheer thrill of clearing the competitive exam, getting the tag of being a genius etc. Whatever your reason is, and there can be many of them, it doesn't matter. As long as you have faith in your reason for succeeding, it will help you get through the tough times. When you feel like it's all over after you are lying bloody, battered and bruised, contemplating meaning of life and pondering over meaninglessness of such pursuits, it is this piece of paper which will help you sail through all the turmoil and tumultuous period and you will come out as a winner."

195,"Q:- What do you do when no one believes in you?

Answer by:- Nicolas Cole. Quora Top Writer.

You believe in yourself.

I can't tell you how many times I have been tested with this very question.

When I was a teenager, all I wanted was to become a professional gamer.  Nobody except a kid I only knew through the World of Warcraft believed in me.  Not my parents.  Not my siblings.  Not my peers.  Nobody.  

When I was 17, I became one of the highest ranked World of Warcraft players in North America, and had the most popular Mage strategy blog on the Internet, with an audience base of ~10,000 readers per day.  

When I turned 18 and found out I had celiac disease, and subsequently had to completely alter my diet and lifestyle, I had no idea how to cope.  I felt awkward and out of place, and ended up trying to make friends by smoking a lot of weed.  I fell into a lot of bad habits, and was labeled a drug addict by my family.  Everyone wrote me off and assumed I was on the fast-track to ending up in jail or dead somewhere.  

The only family member that kept in touch with me was my younger brother, who was barely 11 at the time.  He was the only one that believed in me, and in such simple ways, listened to my pains and issues enough to help me get started on a better path.  I've been sober (weed, alcohol, etc.) for 4 years now.

When I was 19 I decided I wanted to better myself by getting healthy.  I was eating very clean because of my celiac, and I had found out I have an early form of arthritis called Ankylosing Spondylitis—basically it means that if I don't keep my muscles and joints active, they cramp in on themselves and make it hard to move/breathe in the chest.  I started spending a lot of time in the gym, ignoring the friends that wanted to spend their time getting high.  Everybody asked why I was spending so much time trying to ""get big.""  I'd never be able to.  I was born skinny.  I was lanky.  I was bony with an arch in my back.  Why bother?

The result: (See image)

When I turned 20 and decided to transfer colleges to continue down a better path, I ended up at an art school in Chicago.  It was filled with artsy kids and hipster kids and here I was the outcast in my Addidas sweatpants and Nike t-shirt.  I wanted to study creative writing.  Everybody looked at me like some dumb meathead who would never resemble a ""writer.""  Where was my chapeau?  Where was my wool scarf?  Where were my cigarettes, my flask of whiskey?

By the time I graduated, I had a near perfect GPA (I was a straight C student in high school) and my short story about playing video games as an adolescent was featured in the department's 2013 Story Week magazine.  I was then selected by the faculty to speak to prospective students and parents at the Creative Writing open house, sharing with them my experiences and encouraging these parents to let their children study writing—a dilemma I knew all too well, my own father not being very happy with my decision to forgo a more prestigious route, like medical school.

I share some of the above stories not to gloat or draw attention to my accomplishments, but to answer the aforementioned question.  What do you do when nobody believes in you?  You believe in yourself.  You wake up every morning and confront the hard truth that nobody knows where you are going to end up except you.  And it's on you, and only you, to get there.

Once you start to experience this feeling of ""proving the world wrong,"" the hardest lesson you'll have to learn is to not walk around with a chip on your shoulder.  Accomplishing something on your own is the easy part.  The hard part is forgiving all the people (especially those closest to you—family, friends, etc.) that didn't believe in you when you needed it most.  And that's where you just have to accept and understand that sometimes nobody sees your vision except you.  And that's the whole point.  It tests your ability to trust in something that nobody else sees.  Are you crazy?  Are you out of your mind?

No.

You're just believing in yourself."

Vrajesh, the guy in a black suit, gently held Meera's hand. Both walked towards the dance floor.

Soon, with a romantic track, their steps started moving.

""You're truly a gentleman, dear!"" Meera complimented.

""I see. So, that's the reward for asking a beautiful lady to dance."" Vrajesh acknowledged.

""Someone sounds impressive as well."" Meera proceeded her positive words.

""But, your husband doesn't think the same,"" Vrajesh came closer to Meera and whispered, ""He's giving me killer looks since I asked you.""

""Ha ha ha! Oh, don't worry about him. He will get little bit jealous for a while."" Meera explained while dancing to a slow, yet romantic music track.

""Aha! Must say, you know him very well."" Vrajesh added.

""Well, For that, I don't even need to look at him."" Meera added, ""Right now, he might be having a fork in his hand. It must be facing downward in his left hand. Plus, he'll be acting like he is not watching at us. But, I'm damn sure he has taken multiple hidden glimpses.""

Vrajesh scanned and found Meera's words accurate about her husband.

The music track ended. Vrajesh gently escorted Meera to her table. He kissed Meera's hand and complimented, ""Thanks beautiful lady.""

Meera smiled and moved her head vertically. Further, Vrajesh glanced at her husband and said, ""You're so lucky to have an adorable wife, Mr...?""

""Raj. Mr Raj."" Raj answered.

""Okay. Mr. Raj, glad to meet you. Enjoy the party."" Vrajesh added his final words and walked away.

""What a sweet guy!"" Meera complimented.

""What sweet? He looks kinda like a jerk who traps girls. Look at his face. And, for you, everyone is sweet except me, right?"" Raj quickly interrupted.

""Trap girls? Raj, I'm 70. Who will be interested in trapping an old woman. He complimented about my beauty like you do. Gosh, I feel so young and beautiful today. Don't be so jealous after 45 years of marriage."" Meera expressed her feelings.

""Beautiful? Yesterday, you were upset about being old with wrinkles and all that stuff. All of a sudden beautiful today, huh!"" Raj argued.

""Yeah! That was yesterday, not today. I feel different. And sweetie, now can we order anything to eat? Please?"" Meera demanded.

""Only if you won't dance with anyone without me! Deal?"" Raj asked for a deal.

""Okay my old man. Deal."" Meera confirmed and added, ""By the way, I still love it when you feel jealous and insecure because of me. That's so sweet!""

""What? Sweet? Huh! I was not jealous. It was just…leave it. Let's order the food."" Raj ended his words.

Then both of them ordered food and had a candlelight dinner.

Later that night, Vrajesh received an SMS which read - ""Thanks Vrajesh. She feels more confident and beautiful now. Thanks for doing everything for me.""

""I just followed your lead. Anything for you uncle Raj!"" Vrajesh replied.

That's how an old man played the beautiful game of love."

205,"Ques: If you have to choose between being kind and being right, what would you choose and why?

Ans. A patient with a dirty wound and wriggling maggots was brought to Emergency. The wound had pus and was fucking foul smelling. 

I had two options.
To be kind. I could have been gentle as a river to that man's wound. Less manipulation. Less pain to the patient. 

To be right. Wash it thouroughly. Drain all the pus. Drop hydrogen peroxide. Wash again.This would cause him immense pain. 

So, I choose to be right.

Right is mostly painful. Seldom accepted. Less appreciated. Long term benefits are plenty.
It requires courage.

Right courage should flow.

Ans. The antique clock on the wall alerted that it was 8 P.M.

An old man, seated in a chair, looked at the clock and had a tear in his eye.

His wife consoled him as she realised what made him cry.

Their daughter had gotten married just yesterday and their home turned to a house all over again.

“You know something? I never used to forget to take my medicines.” he confessed.

“What? You always used to forget. Our daughter, Meera, would remind you about it everyday.” his wife explained.

“Nah! That was just an excuse. I never forgot to take my medicines. It’s just that I loved it when she would stop by me sharp at 8 P.M.” he confessed a secret.

His wife’s lips curved in happiness.

He further added, “It’s 8 P.M. and I’m missing Meera today.”

The very next moment, his mobile buzzed.

He checked it and found a message from Meera.

“It’s time for your medicines. Please take them.” read the message.

That message delivered happiness in its simple caring words.

Meera’s father was happy that at least his daughter stayed connected with him even now so he replied a smiley - “:).”

Meera’s mobile buzzed, but it was in Raj’s hand.

Raj looked at the messages and started to delete them, but could only manage to erase one of the sent ones before he saw Meera emerge from the washroom.

He quickly threw the mobile on the bed just as Meera approached him and checked her mobile.

She then questioned Raj verbally, “Hey! Why did dad send me a smiley?”

Raj smiled and acknowledged it as, “How would I know?”, keeping his secret as it is.

That day, for the first time, Raj started handling Meera’s responsibilities, as he was now a husband and a family man, in addition to being a doctor.

211,"“WOULD YOU SELL YOUR DREAM FOR AN AUDI A6?”

A friend of mine was preparing for the IAS exam. He belonged to a highly rich and influential family, who saw their son’s IAS preparation as a waste of time. His father wanted him to join family business as soon as possible.

But, this guy was made of something else. He was one of those people who are committed to their dreams, no matter what. He wanted to be an IAS officer, period. No one was going to stand in his way.

He made his resolve clear to his father. His father was displeased. He retaliated by cutting of all his finances.

So, what does this guy do? Does he give up on his dream?

No.

He had had some money saved from a few development projects he had done during his college days. He packed his bags, took out the money, and came to Delhi. Imagine, a boy who was brought up like a prince in a royal environment, giving up all his comforts and renting a dingy room in the dark underbelly of Mukherjee Nagar!

If you think that you know the moral of this story by now, you’re utterly mistaken.

Our story is just starting.

Our guy was determined, but so was his father. He started enticing his son with various “offers”.

First, he told his son that he is ready to double his monthly pocket money (which was already considerable before the finances were cut off), if he’d just come back home.

Then he blackmailed him in the name of his mother (who by the way, was in silent support of her son.)

Then he offered him a position in his own company. (No work and a huge salary!)

This kept going on for months. The guy would reject one offer after another, his resolve always standing strong.

Then one day, out of the blue, I receive a Whatsapp message from him. It said -

“I want you to meet for one last time. Tomorrow, I’m going back home.”

“What happened?” I asked

“My dad just an offered me Audi A6, no strings attached. He just wants me to come home. It’s not a bad deal. I’ll prepare from home.”

That’s it folks. I didn’t reply to him after that. But the entire conversation reminded me of something my father had told me way back when I was a kid -

“Son, there is a saying that goes like this. Whether you achieve something or not depends on one and only one factor - how badly you want it. But that is completely wrong. The truth is - Whether you achieve something or not depends on one, and only one factor - what you are willing to ‘settle for’ instead.”

So, you just saw that dream that is going to change your life! And you’ve resolved to not give up on it, no matter what. That’s great. But resolves are easy to keep when there are no counter-offers on the table. Wait till the deals start coming in. Till the easy-ways-out start showing up. That’s when you’ll be tested. And the bitter truth of this world is that everything is for sale, even dreams. It is just a question of what you are willing to sell it for, and what you are willing to ‘settle for’ instead. And the funny thing is, you would be blissfully unaware of the fact that even your dream is for sale, until somebody comes along and offers the right price.

So, I ask you, the reader -

“Would you sell your dream for an Audi A6?”"

Childhood: What are some of the biggest lies ever told in India?

1. Work hard and make sure you get a high score in class X. Your entire life and career depends on it.

2. Just work for 2 years in XI and XII. If you get in a good medical college/IITs/NITs/Law schools/DU etc., your life is set.

3. Start preparing for your PG/MBA/USMLE/UPSC/GRE/GMAT/GATE etc. otherwise your friend will get the job and you'll be left behind in the race. Once you're settled, you can enjoy as much as you want.

4. You're settled now and the only logical step is to get married. If you don't do it before 30, you'll be considered 'old' and your marriage prospects will diminish. You can enjoy later.

5. Since now you have kids, you need to earn more and work extra to secure their future. Your entire life is left for you to pursue your passions.

Girl 3: Ok. Then?
Girl 1: For that, he told that the accounts are closed. It will not be possible for him to produce a bill. Then, he told that there are still snacks available in the kitchen and he asked us if we need, we can take it for free. (Girl 1 started shouting angrily) How dare he say like that? As if, we don’t have money to get those snacks. Are we the ones who are eating the free foods? What that idiot is thinking of us? I just told him on his face that we don’t need that and we left.
Girl 3: Ok. Calm down. Leave him. Don’t waste your time by thinking about a person who doesn't know the manners.

Luckily for the girl, some early morning walkers turned up who informed her that she was to be in Coimbatore rather than Chennai.

Other walkers pitched in – they asked friends/ contacts to inform the Registrar about the case. By 7.50 am it was agreed to look into the case. Meanwhile breakfast was provided to the mother and daughter .
The sponsor of the flight tickets transported them to the airport by 8.15 am to board the 10.05 am flight to Coimbatore. Arrangements were made to pick them up from Coimbatore airport at 11.40 am by car. They reached the University counselling venue by 12.15 pm

I recharged her phone for 500 something bucks so that she can contact me whenever she needs me. She thanked me and said she was the luckiest girl on earth (I was a fool who took care of all her expenses like tattoos, cosmetics and all girly shits). She left.

(Most people already know this : Girls who knowingly or unknowingly take money from you will definitely leave you some day. Never ever spend a single penny on your girlfriend. Always be mutual. You are as important as her in a relationship.)

And just like all typical breakup stories, she found a new guy and dumped me. She even told me that I am like a brother to her. I was heartbroken. Cried a lot, lost sleep for months, going home or being with friends didn’t help. Chatting, social networking, dating other girls, going for a long walks, watching all the TV series on earth, learning a music instrument and tried all possible things to get her out of my mind.

One day my sister called and said “Papa & Amma’s 25th wedding anniversary is coming up, could you send some good pictures of them. I am thinking of making a collage as a gift.” I didn’t even think. Just went out, withdrew 40k from my account, bought a DSLR( I call him PULSE), took 9 days off work and went home. I took a lot of pictures of my parents, family and friends. My dad still says proudly to his friends “He bought a DSLR with his my own money. He Always wanted one, but I never bought him that. Now he bought one on his own.” I really felt proud of myself whenever he says it. My Amma Papa poses happily in front of Pulse. Me and my sister made a collage, framed it and gifted it to my Parents. I learned to use few editing apps (It is not a difficult task) to get better photos. I don’t take photos like professionals or like people who travel and climb mountains for clicks. I don’t own a photography facebook page or keep a watermark on every photo I click, but wherever I go, I take Pulse with me. I click pictures of my grandparents, friends, my cute little cousins, flowers and fruits in my Mom’s little garden or whenever a guest come over. I can see their smile when I show it to them.I write all the pictures, even stupid ones, in CDs and keep them safe in a case because I know the intensity of emotion which will come to them when they see it after few years ( Inspired by Interstellar).

It actually helped me move on with my life. Now I make friends wherever I go. I keep clicking their smiles and send those clicks to them the which makes them smile even more. I collect smiles like the guy in temple run collect coins.

Keep smiling guys :) :)."
239,"Ever Wondered what does the earphone-like think musicians and singers wear does and why do they wear it?

Answer:- It's called as IEM (In—Ear Monitor)

So, as a musician performing live, you are surrounded by noise. Noise of fans screaming, base guitarists heart bending beats, shredders, drummers in the back and of course, your own voice coming out of microphone and speaker. It all becomes distracting. You need to hear less of your voice, less of drums, optimized base notes and zero(almost) fans screaming.

This device helps here. You can customize which voice you want to hear and which not to. Mostly it works as a noise—reduction device. That's it."

It all happened after Musk told Bloomberg that he was currently reading a book called Twelve Against the Gods by William Bolitho and thought of it as quite good.

Answer by:- Bhaskar Dabhi.

Once me and My friends were visiting White Rann of Kutch first time. The area is monitored by Indian Army.

If any one want to go there then they have to pay entry fee at some village which is 10 km away from the Rann of kutch. Only on that entry ticket, Army person allow you to enter the white desert.

Unfortunately, we didn’t know that and went to white Rann directly and Army person stopped us from entering as we didn't have ticket. We started apologising for the mistake and told them that please allow us to enter as we don't want to go back 10km and travel same distance back as we have travel almost 120Km.

While negotiating(actually apologising) with them, we tried many things to convince them to let us go but they didn’t let us in.

Meanwhile one of my friend said, ""Sir, Jane do na. Jo paise hote he vo lelo. (Sir, Please let us go. You can charge us for same)"".

Army man said ""Sir Hum police wale nhi he. (We are not police officers)"". The words touched our hearts. At last, they let us go only on our Identification proof without paying anything. Though we paid the amount on our way back.

Note:

While saying ""Sir, Jane do na. Jo paise hote he vo lelo. "", we didnt have any intention to bribe the army person but we actually meant that they can take entry fee from their ends."
243,"What is the most heroic thing that you have done?

Answer by:- Nikhil Narayanan

July 20th,2014

Morning-10 am

I was posted in  pediatric ICU . It was not  a busy day. We just had 3 babies currently under monitoring.

One was preterm,2 days old, he needed surfactant therapy for his under developed lungs. Then we had  twin delivery  that day.

After my rounds with the chief, I was  busy updating my lab results and planning for a tea break with other interns.

Call from O.T-An emergency Cesarean case posted. Pediatric intern on duty  and duty doctor needs to report very soon.

I informed my duty doctor and quickly moved towards the theatre. We prepared the  set-up for emergency care of the baby soon after delivery. Bag and mask was ready and all necessary medications for resuscitation.

The delivery went un-eventful and the baby was handed over to us from Obstetric medical team. We started resuscitating him. Cleared his airway via suctioning,did preliminary assessment of his health.

The baby had poor tone, he was not  crying properly either. I could see his toes were bit blue too. All these lead to the signs of poor state of health.

We had to take him to Pediatric ICU for better care. We decided to transfer him and we reached the lift. The bad side to  this  building setup was O.T was placed on 5th floor and pediatric ICU was in ground floor. I always thought this could be dangerous as close proximity  of O.T to pediatric ICU is always best for good care of the babies.

We were waiting for lift service but there was no sign of lift opening up. The technician appeared from nowhere,

""sirji,lift karab he"" (The lift is not working )

Damn!!!

The baby needed immediate intubation,we were 5 floors above and a corridor away from ICU. 
Time was ticking!! We were losing him!

I asked my senior doctor ''Shall I take him and run?'' 

She seemed puzzled and did not know what to say.

I took him in my hands and started running downstairs.

I had no other option either.

My legs were shivering ,as I ran with  new born in my hand who is still gasping to get some air.

I kept running downstairs.

I could feel his  little heart beating against my chest.

I could not see the stairs properly. It seemed a never ending stairs  :-D.

Stupidest thing I could  ever do,with a baby in my hand.

I slipped once but had good hold of him.

Finally in a matter of few minutes, I reached down and was gasping like hell....

It was like a movie.

I was miles ahead with baby  in my hand, 
his father right behind me and duty doctor trying to keep up with the pace. :)

I finally rushed into the ICU,

the chief with other doctors came in from other room.

I did not wait to answer him.

I yelled  "" Need to Intubate him quickly"" .

Now, when I think about it, I was an intern then, 
I was yelling at my Chief, ridiculous :-D

 He quickly got in and we intubated him. 
The duty doctor came in shortly after long run and revealed the whole story.

More importantly baby survived after 2 long days of poor health.The whole medical team congratulated me for good presence of mind but cautioned me to be careful while running too ;)

This was 2nd event of my medical career where I  could feel God was playing through me to save this soul else I would not  be courageous enough to take him and run. Its insane thought and it was hell dangerous.

After primary resuscitation in ICU, 
nurse called me up and told me baby's dad wanted to meet me, I came out to see him.
He touched my feet and thanked me!

I felt so awkward but I was touched by his gratitude.

I said it was my  duty to do so, anyone would have done.

Then I realized this baby was  an answer to their prayers after 10 years of marriage and this survival meant him everything in this world.

I was feeling happy about the fact I could be reason for his happiness. :)
The most interesting part is,after 1 month, in follow up checkup, the couple came up to meet me and  I would not  lie....

he said..."" We want you to name him"" 
I was like...no way!!..they made me so privileged to name their son.

I said ""Am happy for you. But you truly deserve to name your son''

Though he insisted a name,I did suggest one but I do not know if they named him. :)

I did not see them later.

It has been almost 2 years now.

Wishing someday  I meet him :)"

255,"Would you support dividing Uttar Pradesh(One of the state of India) into smaller states?

Balaji Viswanathan

Yes. Uttar Pradesh has 75 districts and 18 divisions. Many of these 75 districts are bigger than many countries. It is impossible to manage such a big state and it also weakens the identity. In the south, we used to have such large provinces - Madras and Bombay - and those had weak identity & governance issues. Once they were divided into multiple states, both governance and identity improved.

In the same way, north had Punjab as a huge province and once it was divided into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal. They are all doing well in economy. In the Northeast, Assam was divided to form many of the Northeastern states. They are all doing well in human development.

Time to do the same to India's center. Here is my imagination of the new states:

Kosala or Awadh: This is a region bordering Nepal and would roughly correspond with the ancient kingdom of the same name. Would include Faizabad, Lucknow and Devipatan divisions. They could tap a lot into tourism, given the plethora of cultural elements. Awadhi could be its official language.

Prayag: This would include the Allahabad and Kanpur divisions, with a core focus on factories, besides tourism.

Mughal: This would include the heart of the Mughal territory - Agra, Aligarh, Moradabad, Meerut, Saharanpur, Bareilly. Leather, refineries and tourism could be its top industries. Urdu and Brajbhasha could be its official languages.

Braj/Mathura: This would for Mathura, Mainpuri etc with official language as Brajbhasha.

Bundelkhand: This is the hilly, mystic UP/MP with Khajuraho, Jhansi and Chitrakoot. Tourism, especially eco-tourism could be a major draw. Bundeli will be its official language.

Varanasi or Ganga: This will be the eastern part of UP with Varanasi, Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Basti and Azamgarh. This will be the cultural heart of India. Agriculture and textiles could be its main industry.

These 6 states would on an average have about 3 crore people and would be in the right size to be governed. They could all have official languages different from Hindi and build an identity of their own, along with the national identity."

.
.
.

I was once travelling from Mysore to Bangalore in a train. Beside me there was a man. We both struck up a conversation since 3 hours of the ride can get boring.

He was a resident of Mysore but often traveled to Mecca and back because he was the Sales director of a well known group of Hotels. He is a Muslim and was very insightful.

We were talking about everything. He told me a lot about the Quran and how so many people misinterpret so many things written in it. He then said, he really liked me as a independent women with a mind of her own.

He only gave me one advice: If you marry someone, make sure you can live with the guy for the next 30- 35 years of your life. Trust me, that is a long long time. Don't take the idea of being married to someone so lightly. It can change your life forever.

Don't fall for his bank balance. Don't fall for his looks. Fall for his heart. A good heart goes a long way to sustain your self respect and will improve your life ten folds. That is because good hearted and happy people believe in giving back. Money is not all unimportant...but it is not the thing that will make you happy. I own a flat in a high rise apartment in Mecca and every morning when I wake up, all I need to do is push aside my blinds and I can see the Kaaba of Mecca (The Shrine). I pray every morning. There is one thing that I am very thankful to Allah is,  for having me given a wonderful wife who is my best friend and takes care of our kids. Every time I am away from home, I miss my wife and my kids.  Make sure you end up with someone who makes you feel happy when you wake up in the morning. Make sure you end up with someone who values your individuality and pushes you forward in life. Don't marry an anchor.

So, spend some time out with the guy and see what makes him tick and then decide. If you don't like him, then don't marry him irrespective of what your parents and relatives have to say. You have to live with that guy, you will need to share a room with him, not your parents and relatives. So,  find someone worth being around with.  Find a friend in him before you find a life partner.

Those words have never left me."

.
.
.

Peculiar Social Stigma.

When I was in class XII, there was a girl in my class who got pregnant. The news spread entire campus like fire in the jungle.

She went on leave for two months, everybody talked for sometime then everything went normal. 
It was the time when she came back everyone started misbehaving with her.  Everyone became foul mouthed with her. Rest talked bad things behind her back and it continued till the end of the academic year. Much to the disgust was the lady who was our chemistry teacher. She beat her many times and each of the time she beat her, she ensured to keep all the frustration out on the poor girl. 
Sometimes we,  friends,  felt very bad for her but couldn't do anything as we also were the part of the crowd which I regret about.

I clearly remember once I asked her for practical record file with a genuine smile. Goodness she was ecstatic,  I can see the happiness in her eyes. It seemed she was waiting for this for the long time. And this was my only interaction with her in the school.

She met me couple of years ago in a mall and she approached me and when I talked to her I realized she has changed a lot. She became jovial and bubbly.

Why?

Because she joined new college where nobody knew of her past and she rejuvenated herself.

Sometimes I feel society is unjust. Rather than socially boycotting an individual, we should accept her wholeheartedly. It keeps of the trauma and individual get the time to collect back their spirits and start their new journey.

260,"How can I as a General Category person in India contribute in removing casteism?

Answer by: Awdhesh Singh, Senior IRS Officer
.
.
.
.

Your question is based on the assumption that there is any class called ‘General class/caste’. The fact is that there are dozens of castes within the so called general category castes and hundreds of sub-castes within these castes. There is nothing like a ‘higher caste’ or ‘general castes’ in India as the castes are spread over infinite stratum. In fact the same caste (like Jats) may be in general category in one state while in a reserved category in another state.

These so called upper castes are fighting with each other on multiple platforms. One of my relative’s daughter who was a Rajput (kshatriya) wanted to marry a Brahmin boy a few years ago. It created so much turbulence within the family. It was only after years of struggle and the tremendous determination of the girl and the boy that the marriage could take place. The family only reluctantly participated in the marriage knowing that they have no other option.

General category candidates have only one thing is common i.e. their opposition against the reservation system where all of them are the loser. Instead of trying to get united as one, they themselves are fighting pitched battle for reservation.

The only way that the general category candidate candidates can contribute in removing castiesm is not to hate those who are claiming reservation. They must understand that they too would have claimed these benefits, if it would have been available to them.

When the law of your country permits some benefits, you can’t vilify those who are claiming their legal and constitutional rights.

.
.
.

Do Not Discuss People. Discuss ideas instead.

Do Not Be Jealous. Firstly, it is extremely meanly. Secondly, it makes you look miserable. Thirdly, this feeling has never made anybody happier, luckier or more successful.

Do Not Compare Yourself With Others. Live your own life and make sure it goes smoothly in the right direction.

Do Not Overwork. Hard work has nothing to do with productivity. Work smarter instead of working harder.

Do Not Be rude. Rudeness never shows your power but rather makes you look ridiculous and silly. Impress people with your politeness and let them respect you for that.

Do Not Be Impulsive. Every time you disagree with something do not make hasty conclusions or decisions. Give it a chance and let it settle down in your mind for a while. Soon you can notice how your opinion regarding that issue has changed.

Do Not Doubt Yourself Too Much. Embrace the truth. You are braver than you believe, smarter than you think and stronger than you seem. Go and get it!

Do Not Be Afraid To Act. Fear is a reason that paralyzes people and stops them from taking action. Overcome your fears and start acting confidently.

Do Not Spend Hours Surfing On Social Networks. Social networks are a great source of communication, interesting stories and funny pictures. But make sure you are not killing time from dawn till dusk there.

Do Not Lose Details. While being focused on big picture, do not forget about tiny details. They do really matter.

Do Not Lose Eye Contact. Develop a habit to look another person in his eyes while having a dialogue. It will let your partner be sure that you are listening carefully and you are totally involved.

Do Not Sacrifice Your Sleep. Go to bed on time and have a good night`s rest. Good sleep is crucial for your creativity and long-term productivity.

Do Not Lose Ideas. Always have a notepad with you. Every time you have an idea that pops up in your mind, take a minute to write it down or sketch it. Do not suppose that you will recall it later. They usually vanish.

Do Not Hang Out With Pessimistic People. There are already a lot of bad and ugly things in this beautiful world that every once in a while make you upset.

Do Not Lose Time Purposelessly. Spend every free minute you have with benefit. Read a book. Listen to podcast. Think. Dream. Act.

Do Not Forget To Exercise Regularly. Good, exhausting, intense workouts. This is what lets you stay in a good shape, abstract from the daily routine and devote time to yourself.

Do Not Postpone Anything. Especially the things that matter. The sooner you start moving toward your dreams the sooner you will enjoy the results of this journey.

Do Not Stop Studying. Knowledge is crucial. If you do not want to be left behind, you need to constantly improve your knowledge and acquire new skills.

Do Not Stop Smiling. Do it sincerely. Let your smile change the world.

Do Not Be Too Realistic. Leave some place for miracles. Believe in impossible and give weird ideas a chance.

Do Not Take People For Granted. Every single person in your life is worth appreciating.

Do Not Leave Any Reasons For Regret. Take action now in order not to regret about missed opportunities in the future.

Do Not Avoid Changes. Changes usually involve new opportunities, growth and development. Welcome them and let changes make your life more interesting and diverse.

Do Not Give Up Chasing Your Dreams. Commit to your dreams and make them come true.

I was a 1st year resident doctor in Pediatrics back then. The schedule was hectic as hell. I used to take bath every 15–20 days, and shave every 2–3 months back then. I have lost 21 kgs weight during first 6 months of residency. No phone calls, no family, no home, no entertainment, no songs, no movies, no music. I used to sleep (3–4 hours at max) in the ward itself and literally never came out of the hospital in that 1st year.

I was taking care of that patient and also another 50 very sick kids. When I was trying to insert IV line in his hand, that Intravenous catheter fallen on my leg and I got a needle stick injury. My Senior rushed me to the infectious disease specialist. I was put on 4 ART (drugs for AIDS) for next 28 days.

Now here I am… 23rd year of my life… who has spent his whole life securing more than 90 percent of marks… sacrificed all possible entertainment in my adult life… never smoked… never touched alcohol… did nothing wrong to anyone… And I was on the verge of becoming HIV reactive. I had to go through the HIV test at 3 months and 6 months after that incident. If those tests come normal, then only I am 100% sure that I have not got infected… Those 6 months was like hell…

I continued working in a hospital… I continued treating that same patient… When that patient was out of danger and somewhat stabilized, I filled his discharge card.

And finally the D day arrived. Both reports came Normal after 6 months. I was so happy. I donated my blood after one month.

Yes, We are doctors… We may get infected while treating you… HIV… TB… Swine flu… H1N1… and many more… When people scared to death to even come close to you… We welcome you… We treat you… We put ourselves in danger… Not for money… But to bring you back to life…!

No one is rich enough to pay us. We put our life’s hard and intelligent work to treat you. How much can you pay me if I save your kid’s life???

267,"What are the common traits of highly intelligent people?
.
.
.
.

Stare more at the walls than people.

Imagination never leaves them. Without imagination, they are nothing.

Leave the group when they find people in them incompatible to them.

Generally polite, mature, good knowledge about philosophy of life.

Find uncomfortable to follow the rules.

Struggle a lot in their work. That is what gives them happiness.

Lot of self-respect for themselves.

In silence, they are always happy and peaceful.

All they need is love. That can attract them strongly.

.
.

Background: This happened when i was in 7th grade. We had a very young and beautiful maths teacher, who also happened to be our class teacher. Needless to say, most of the guys in our class had a crush on her.

The incident: It was 13th of february, monday. Valentines week was going on. We had an off on friday for some reason and saturday, sunday were naturally holidays.

I was standing with some other boys and girls of our class and chit chatting and our maths teacher entered the class and saw a boy giving a chocolate to a girl. Maybe she found it cute and suddenly turned towards us and asked the group, ""it was chocolate day before your 3 day break, where is my chocolate?""

I usually talk without thinking when i am near my friends.

And i turned towards the teacher, looked her right into her eyes and said.

""Ma'am today is kiss day, where is my kiss?""

I realized what i had said, but it was too late to bring back the arrow which had already left the bow.

The whole class burst into laughter, the teacher smiled a little out of embarrasment and opened her register for attendance.

Every guy in the class started giving me witty smiles, like i had achieved something. But i was scared inside.

As soon as the attendance got over the teacher exclaimed. ""Now that the attendance is over, Mr.Malhotra you may leave my class and stand outside for the entire day"".

I left the class without a word.

Later, this news spread like wildfire in the whole batch.

For the rest of the year every student saw me as a hero and every teacher saw me as a pervert.

This incident was narrated to my parents on my final result day. Dad had a hearty laugh while my mom scolded the shit out of me.

""Typical case of men will be men."""
269,"What is/was your career when you are/were 22 years old?
.
.
.

I got married when I was 19, had my first baby at 21. I lost my brother (in a freak accident) at 21. Until then I was a full time homemaker.

At 22 I started taking care of my dad’s business and simultaneously did a diploma (a 1 year course) in interior designing (we are into furniture manufacturing and retailing).

I remember taking care of my 5 month old baby, cooking breakfast (and packing) lunch for my husband,a software engineer, drop my baby at her grandmother’s,rush to the class, pick up daughter on the way back home. Again get ready and rush to our showroom and factory, back in time for dinner, cook, feed, put baby to sleep and then sit and finish my projects (given as part of the interior designing course).

In between all this I had to bring my parents out of heartbreak and depression over losing their son,their support system,their Angel,their first and only love (it took me almost 7 years for this and I still can't say they're out of it completely. Losing a child is horrible and I hope to God nobody has to ever go through it.)

My day always started at 7 am and ended at 4 am. My husband wasn't too helpful (misogynist :( ) and parents were in no state to help.

Now when I think about it I don't know how I did it all. I don't know if I would be able to do it now. All I can say is I did it because I wanted to. I did it because I wanted to show my parents and husband and all the naysayers that I could do it. I did it because I wanted to keep the business going (dad was in depression and in no state to run it). I did it because I didn't have a ‘degree’ (graduation) to my name. I did it so my daughter would think of me as a strong woman,I wanted to set an example for her.

So to answer the question-at 22 I started my ‘higher’ studies and also my career as a businesswoman. My 22nd year was a remarkably tough and the most fulfilling year of my life.

14th July, 2016.

Govt Medical College, Amritsar.

A critical patient infested with maggots was brought to the Medicine Department. Our Post-graduates did everything round the clock for the already dead man. The patient died.

The attendants thrashed the Doctors. They were physically abused to the point that they got fractures and bruises.

So, It is stupid to be a Doctor. It is stupid to be a Post-graduate. Yes, We are depressed. We are scared. We are demons. What else we can be ?

We do everything we can as a Doctor. We do 100 hours duties in a go. We do not have time to eat our foods. We seldom party. We do not know anything about our personal life. We fucking do not have a life. Yet, we are always happy serving people.

We are humans. We are no Demi-Gods. If a patient dies after every effort we make, nobody has the right to beat us. Our parents raised us to be Doctors, to serve and not to get thrashed and killed by nonsense mob.

In our case, patient was infested with maggots. The patient was totally neglected. How can the attendants blame us for the death ? How can they beat us ?

Why don't people beat the retards who dump their girl child in garbage bins ?

Why don't people beat the child who abandons their parents in hospitals ?

Why don't people beat the rapists and addicts ?

Why us ?

Why can not our demands for justice be met by anyone?

Why no one comes forward for our support ? Why no one keeps our back protected ?

People in India do not respect Doctors. I am an Intern. I hate being the part of this profession now. The hate is because of people who fail to see through the effort we make. That is why people do USMLE and leave India.

We do not want appreciation. Do not abuse us. This is not a request. We know our job. We love to do it.

Yes, I am depressed. Every Doctor in India is. Thanks to some mindless morons. Thank you for making us scared about our profession. Thank you for taking our respect and pride. Thank you for everything. Thank you for beating us.

1st year , Basic Electrical Engineering class. We had common classes with the Computer Science Engineering students , so every Electrical Engineering (Yes , my branch) student was excited to attend that particular class (CSE had most beautiful girls , most importantly , it had Girls!! :P).
I sat with my then room-mate who liked a girl in the CSE batch.
The scene :-
Professor engrossed in explaining some theorem ,some students trying to comprehend ,some of them trying real hard to fake attentiveness, most of them-""babe watching"".
My room mate was constantly staring at his crush , it was so unsubtle, even the professor engrossed in his pedagogy notices him.
Let's call the professor 'P' , room-mate 'R' and his crush 'C'.

P: You with the pink top , stand up.

'C' stands up

P: what's your name and branch ?

C: It's 'C' from CSE.

'P' writes it on the white board

'R' is still staring as if this is what he was born for.

P: 'C' in which hostel are you residing, ?

C: Sir I'm a localite , residing at XYZ street , house number 1234 
(Now she's getting uncomfortable)

P writes all that detail on the Board.

'R' still fulfilling the purpose of his birth

P: *very calmly* Black shirt at the back! Pay attention! *points towards the details collected*

'C'
XYZ street , house number 1234

""It's all there on the board , do you want me to get her number for you as well ? Visit her and do that yourself! , Now please.CONCENTRATE!!""

In those days, there was no telephone...but thank God for that -- I have each and every one of the letters he's ever written to me...and we've been married 52 years!

“You deserve to be thrown out. You aren’t fit for this place – we only want to have people who deserve to be here. This is the time when you realise you’ll be mediocre and the regret of having been thrown out will teach you a lesson.”

Professor at IIT Delhi when I was being thrown out of the university at the end of the first year – I didn’t have enough credits to continue in the college. It was this professor who had promised me a re-test since I had flunked his course. I slogged for 2 days (without sleeping) to turn up for the retest. He handed out the answering sheet to me, only to change his mind in five minutes after which he snatched it away saying what he said.

A year later, IIT Delhi was taken to the Supreme Court over punishing students in this manner, where they lost the case and they had to send a letter of apology and re-invitation to all the students. I received the letter and flatly refused. I continued to study in a “second grade” institute."

A couple of incidents in recent time have changed my mindset about delivery guys.

1. It was late in night when I returned back from work, I was hungry and tired. Ordered food online.
Delivery boy called me up asking for exact location. Mind wasn’t in peaceful condition, so I asked him why doesn’t he use Maps an told him to look it up in phone GPS.
And he replied,
“Sir, it’s raining heavily outside and I can’t use phone. Internet is not working properly. I’m using headset right now to talk with you.”
Ah!
I felt pretty bad for self for behaving hardly to him. Quickly, I empathised with him and guided till he reached doorstep.
Digital navigation is hard on 2-wheeler.

2. Second incident is also related to ordering online. Learning from the incident 1, I directed delivery boy nicely. The order contained two servings of buttermilk — which he forgot to bring for us.
He apologized for the err and as I wouldn’t be left hungry if I wouldn’t have received buttermilk, I told him that its alright for me. I won’t have any issues.
He left…and after 10 minutes I found him knocking door again!
I was surprised to see him with two packets of buttermilk! I asked why. I had already told him not to worry about the missing items. Then why?
He replied,
“You might have called to customer care and complained about items that I forgot to bring. They would have summoned me and asked me for reason. In all, it might have been a lot of pain for me which I don’t want to deal with. Thus, I went to market and bought these from my own pocket.”

285,"What advice would you give to your 22 year old self?

Answer by G Vishwanath

A:- At 22, I was in the final year of my engineering studies at BITS Pilani.

I did not consider applying for admissions in US Universities for my Master’s degree.

That was a blunder and it has had a major influence on my life.

The main reason was that I could not be sure of assistantship and my parents (middle class people) had already spent a heavy amount on me during the 5 years at Pilani and my father was getting close to retirement. They had two other sons too. It was criminal to subject them to the exorbitant expenditure involved in Post Graduate Engineering education at USA, though admissions were very easy for students of my background, with degrees from IIT or Pilani. Jobs after studies were more or less assured. The present H1B visa quotas were not an issue then, and neither was it difficult to get admission and a job later.

The advice I would have given myself is that I should not have given up my ambitions on the issue of money.

I should have ventured to take a loan from the bank, covering the first year’s expenses and proceeded to USA. Almost everyone would get some assistantship those days,after the first semester was over. Students would take up part time jobs assisting their Professors, in their research projects or do a few hours of Library work or even take up tutoring children in Math and some even worked as waiters in restaurants or at cash counters at shopping malls to earn some extra money. I was afraid I would not be able to earn and support myself and so took the safe way out. I decided to study here in India and got admission at Roorkee with a Government scholarship. I got my master’s degree and was soon placed in a moderately paying public sector job which I held on to for the next 28 years.

In life, if you are not enterprising, and not willing to take risks, you should not complain at how it has treated you. While even after staying in India I did not do badly in life, if I had taken up the challenge and risks, of going to USA at that time, I would have done much better in my career with a US degree and a life long career in a good company in USA and today I would have retired with a bank balance several times my present balance.

Many of my mediocre friends in college did much better financially in life because even though they did not match me in acadmic performance, they had the guts to venture out of the country.

I did not allow this to happen to the next generation in my family. I encouraged both my daughter and son to plan their future and now draw satisfaction from the fact that they did much better than I did. My daughter got her Master’s degree from USA, she is settled in USA, married, has a child and is in a good job for the last 16 years, The entire cost of her Master’s education was recouped in a few months after she got a job. My son is likewise settled in UK and teaches at Cambridge University after getting his graduate, Masters and doctorate from Oxford university.

Now I have no regrets.

You have asked me what advice I would give to my 22 year old self and this is what I should have done at 22.

I am 67 now. I now have plenty of advice to give my 30, 40, and 50 year old self too, regarding career, job, and family and personal matters but these cannot be shared in a public forum.

Life is like that. The exams come first. The lessons come after you pass or fail"

The way she hums her favourite song when listening it through headphones.

The way she talks to me via Skype when I’m away from home.

The tone in which she asks me - Deii, nee yaara yavadhu love panriya? (Hey, are you in love with someone?)

The way she gets amazed on seeing modern technologies like Elon Musk’s Hyperloop. She goes like - Dei, idhu ellam yapadi da panra? (Hey, how do they do such incredible things?)

The way she smiles when I appreciate her cooking.

The way she smiles on seeing me after a long time.

The way she serves me the first meal after a long time.

The way she covers me with the blanket after I lie down.

The way she puts a disappointed face after an arguement.

The way she hugs me after every little fight of ours.

There’s an innocence that I see in all these things she does and I chuckle everytime.

Mothers are the most innocent yet intelligent beings in the world. :’)"
292,"What is the craziest thing you've done in public?
.
.
.

When I was 16 (mid 80’s) my parents took my sister and I on a trip to Europe. While in London we visited the original Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum.

First of all if you have never visited one of the now many Tussaud’s I highly recommend it. These museums have many human figures that very closely resemble their famous counter parts.

Back to my visit, the first room I entered was filled with several wax models of ordinary people of all ages out in the open. You could walk right up to the and touch them. They are super realistic, down to the smallest detail.

Well the prankster in me came out, I stood perfectly still next to a few of the models. I stood there for about 3–4 minutes and then two “old” (how I remember them) approach me and looked right at me, one said “they look so real”. Then the other touched my arm. I quickly moved my head as to look at her then ran off, scaring the crap out of them."

Answer by :- Vineet Sharma. 

When everyone was busy preparing for 10th board, he was crying beside body of his mother wrapped in white sheet. His Parents met with an accident and that separated him from his beloved mother. His father survived the accident.

He forgot all grudges with the God and began living his life. To take care of him and his younger brother, father got married again. But for him, Stepmom was just a burden. He cleared 12th board, cracked then AIEEE with decent rank and took admission in one of the private Colleges.

In final year of the college, his dad got heart attack and due to multiple complications father got bedridden. His father needed blood every other month. He and his college friends were amongst the constant donors.

At the end of the final year when everyone busy mugging up Books, he was doing the final rites of his father who couldn't survive one more heart attack. And on top of it, Stepmom filed case against him and his brother for claiming a part of property. Alongwith the whole mess, he was giving final year exams with minimal preparation.

He always thought of getting into a core company of electrical but need of time brought him in an interview of Tech Mahindra. He made an HR emotional when she asked him why should we hire you ? And He replied : My mom died when I was in 10th, My father died few days ago, My stepmom filed case against us and I have a younger brother who wants to study. I need money and for it I could do anything you want me to do.

Desperation and a bit of programming knowledge got him Selected.

Later on, He got himself and his brother out of the case, funded his brother’s study and supported himself to keep on going in the hard times.

Currently he is working with One of the finest company of Automation Testing in Hyderabad, he got married to the girl he loved since school days, his brother got into the government company in Hyderabad itself.

He, who is the mentally strongest person I have ever met. He is my childhood friend."
294,"Life Tips.!!

Answer by:- Naincy Jain

1. Arjun :- I can’t find free time. Life has become hectic.

Krishna:- Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.

2. Arjun :- Why has life become complicated now?

Krishna :- Stop analyzing life... It makes it complicated. Just live it.

3. Arjun :- Why are we then constantly unhappy?

Krishna :- Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy.

4. Arjun :- Why do good people always suffer?

Krishna :- Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don’t suffer.
With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.

5. Arjun :- You mean to say such experience is useful?

Krishna :- Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. It gives the test first and the lessons later.

6. Arjun :- Because of so many problems, we don’t know where we are heading…

Krishna:- If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.

7. Arjun :- Does failure hurt more than moving in the right direction?

Krishna:- Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.

8. Arjun :- In tough times, how do you stay motivated?

Krishna :- Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.

9. Arjun :- What surprises you about people?

Krishna :- When they suffer they ask, ""why me?"" When they prosper, they never ask ""Why me?""

10. Arjun :- How can I get the best out of life?

Krishna:- Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.

11. Arjun :- One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.

Krishna:- There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live."
295,"China did not let India to be part of NSG then why India can't ban the Chinese products in India?

Balaji Viswanathan's Answer

That will be silly and immature. Let’s say you play a game of Cricket and you are not given a batting chance. Would you pick your bat & stumps and go home? Would that be a sign of maturity? While you should fight for your batting chance and stand up to bullying, you should also learn to work in a team & not run away from it.

Indian leadership is a fairly matured one and thus doesn’t play stupid mind games. It will continue to work with China & other countries, while pushing for its rights. India wants to be a leader and an essential part of leadership is dealing with disappointments & not getting the stuff they wanted."

.
Answered By:Hari Sriram

Ans-Mental Stability.
My uncle is a great example of people being mentally stable.
Once, he won a car in some random lucky draw contest. He was informed about this through phone by the organisers of the contest. After ending the phone call, he informed us the same in a very normal tone with a smile on his face. He said that and went back to do what he was doing earlier.
His father passed away at an unexpected age. It happened all of a sudden. He was consoling the family, calling people and making arrangements for the last rites very calmly. He shedded few tears before lighting his father’s pyre. That was it.
The ability to remain calm and composed and not letting the situation influence our decisions is one the most unfair advantages someone can have.

“I saved my relationship using an application called ‘Tasker’”

Yes, I had automated my Whatsapp to send ‘Sorry’ , ‘I love you’ and couple of other messages every 15 seconds for 7 hours straight to my girl friend.

Short background: Being a classic nerd I was, my girlfriend used to complain about how I don’t put any time or effort in our relation and always keep working on my interests. One day we had a big argument on similar lines which made her very angry and upset. I am someone who believes in expressing love by being supportive and helping with important things in life rather than trying to impress the girl with cheesy/romantic stuff (later on I learnt there should be a healthy mix of both for a happy relation :P). I decided to apologize to her by sending some texts. But my past experiences had taught me that a single ‘Sorry’ and ‘I love you’ would be reverted with the extremely dangerous ‘K’/’hmm’/’GTH’ etc. Then this amazing application called ‘Tasker’ came to my rescue which can do a hell lot of things based on one’s imagination. What it does is automate/schedule things you manually need to do like ‘Opening an application’ ,‘Typing a message’, ‘Switching off WiFi’ etc. I had written a code such that it opens the application, search my GF’s name and send pre-written texts in specified intervals. After tens of iterations and approximately an hour, finally I came out with the perfect code that sends a message every 15 seconds from 11:30 P.M. to 6:30 A.M. Voila!!

I scheduled them and had a sound 8 hour sleep which was interrupted by my GF’s phone calls. She was pleasantly surprised by those thousands of messages she received and was extremely happy that I finally learnt to put in effort to show my affection towards her ( i.e. typing all the messages by being awake all night). I buried the truth just in case I had to use it sometime later :D"
299,"Employees, what was the biggest tip you've ever received from a customer?
.
.
.

The biggest tip I ever got was ""$55,007 and more"" from one customer. Yes, ""fifty five thousand and seven (US) dollars and more"" from one customer.

I have to go anonymous because I do not want to reveal this customer's identity.

Here is what happened:

In March, I was working as a hairstylist in California. It was a brutal and busy Saturday and at 5:55 pm (5 minutes before closing), this one as*hole walked in.

I told him that we already closed (shame on me). He said that he had to fly out of state for work in few hours, and he needed his hair done (his hair was a freaking mess), and our shop was the only place opened still. My co-workers gave me the laser eyes beam from the back; they all wanted to go home. I said (with a smile/smirk): ""I will do it"", then I asked my co-workers to go home and told them I would close the shop by myself later.

After the greeting and figuring out what he wanted for his hair; I started working my magic. Then, he started to fall asleep on my chair. So I told him: ""If you fall asleep on my chair, you will be wowed when you wake up (sarcastic)"".

Him (smile): Sorry about that.

Me: I hope you get paid enough to work that hard (he looked like a half dead owl).

Him: Ohh, it is just a crazy time at work right now. The company is laying off a lot of people.

Me: I hope you don’t work in finance, they are cutting back like crazy.

He stared at me and said: I do work in finance, and yes, the industry is cutting back.

Me: Yeahh!! I graduated with a finance degree a couple of months ago but can’t find a job yet. Everywhere I go, there is a temporary hiring freeze.

Then we talked about economy, finance, while i was doing his hair. Then, he asked me, “What is your experience doing finance work?""

Me: I am a CFA level 2 candidate now, sitting for the June exam. Real experience wise, I dont have much. While I was in school, I was a professor’s assistant, so I taught finance classes for my professors when they decided to be lazy. Does that count?

Him: CFA level 2? How?

Me: I passed the level 1 exam in December while I was in school and I am doing level 2 now.

Him: While working fulltime the entire time?

Me: Yup.

Him: How is your Excel?

Me: Not a master Jedi yet but comfortable enough to learn what I don’t know pretty fast.

Him: Do you know anything about Performance Analysts?

Me: Umhmmm, yeah. Let’s say, here is the philosophy: “We need to know where we have been, in order to figure out where we will go"". The performance analyst takes care of the first part of that philosophy.

Then, we talked a bit more about my school and things going on in the economy. Then, he gave me a $7 tip for his hair service.

After that, l locked the door and started to close the register. He came back and knocked the door. I though: ""Shit my life! A redo? Did I make a boo boo on his hair?""

I opened the door and he gave me his business card, then said: ""You are hired! Send me your resume"".

That customer was a VP at one of the three largest banks (by AUM) in the world (he is also Quora Top Writer) I sent him my resume, then i was contacted by HR for a job interview.

I called him to thank him for the opportunity. He told me that he was impressed by my hard work, and he decided to ""interview"" me while I was doing his hair (I did not even pay attention).

I got the job offer 1 week after the interview. The salary is $55,000, which is very high for my area (I do not live in the bay area).

That was the best and last tip I ever got as a hairstylist."

303,"'College at the age of 18, a job at the age of 23-24, marriage at the age of 25 or so'- is one way to live your life. Perhaps, it's not the only way.

I have seen that the people who don't seem to follow this monotonous pattern, created by the society, are labelled with vague terms. When people get to know that I had dropped a year, they tell me that I am lagging behind.

But never do they tell me- 'behind whom' or 'behind what'.
Well, they can't. Because when you are busy living 'your' life, you can neither be behind nor ahead of anything or anyone.

I know a man who's almost thirty and is still working hard to build something. I know a girl who's already twenty and is going to spend two more years to secure an MBBS seat in another country. I know a guy who started pursuing his passion at the age of twenty-three and has almost started excelling in his field. I know a couple who are in their mid-60s and have started learning a foreign language.

And I know many of you, who are stuck in odd places, where you don't even want to stand. You want to choose another road, but you can't. Only because you think that it's too late, or you're too old or maybe because someone has told you that you have to settle before the age of twenty-four or whatever.

And somewhere, you have forgotten that life has more to offer than the random digits that determine how many candles you have to blow on your birthday.

To the people who are afraid to pursue their dreams because they fear that they will lag behind- chase your dreams and do whatever you like. Everything is nothing but a social construct. If a group of people will now follow something else, it will become a new trend. But make sure that you are doing what makes you happy.

And to the courageous people who don't care about what society says or thinks, keep going. There's a silly useless girl who will always admire you. And on days when she is tired, she will look at you and forget the thought of giving up.

309,"5 most important things for man to learn in life.!!

I'm 48. Here's what a man should know.

A) QUIT YOUR JOB

You can't get rich at a job. You have to get rich by either starting a business or having multiple streams of income.

Don't quit your job tomorrow. Be a man. Be responsible. Just do it over time but every day move towards this goal.

Why do you need to get rich? Is this particular to a man?

Not really. Woman should do this also. But historically, men in our society have been the bread earners and you will feel better about yourself if you can do it.

So do it.

B) DON’T LET SOMEONE ELSE VALIDATE YOU

If you want to make a TV show, make a video. If you want to write a book, write it and self-publish.

If you want to be an investment banker, find one company that wants to get sold and another company that wants to buy it and put yourself in the middle. You don't need to be ""chosen"" by Goldman Sachs.

If you want an education, find a way to learn online. You don't need to get a degree in X to be X (unless legally).

C) HEALTH.

Men die earlier than women.

There's really only three keys to better health. I'll add a fourth.

Sleep well. Eat well. Low stress. And to help all of the above go faster, exercise.

Fill in the blanks how you want to get the above done. It doesn't matter. As long as you are aware of how important the above four towards living to be 100 with high quality of life then you will do it.

D) DON’T OUTSOURCE YOUR SELF ESTEEM

Sometimes I've met a woman and I've basically given her all of my self-esteem to take care of.

Then she gets tired of me, bored of me, and dumps me, and now she's taken my self-esteem away until i find it again.

It's hard enough for any one person to manage their own self-esteem, let alone yours.

Take care of your own self-esteem.

E) CREATIVITY

When you are creative, you become competent. Every day try to do one creative thing a day that makes you feel good.

This is one way to make yourself your priority and never anyone else.

Does this seem selfish? It totally is.

But 1% a day improvement in creativity compounds you into a giant among people.

You will feel good, you will have better relationships with people, you will be able to do what you want.

Oh, there’s one more and it’s basically obvious. Always be honest. See? Obvious."

I knew that was an awkward & embarrassing situation for her so I tried to just give her my shirt and leave immediately. I also told her that some half-witted persons are laughing at you so please take my shirt and tie around your waist.

Each time he asked his father (my uncle) to let him take animation and graphic designing in further studies, he had to listen to lectures filled with phrases like “If you had scored good marks you would have become an engineer!” or “No one takes this stupid course, whats the scope?”. My cousin was not allowed to speak after that.

Now it happens that TOI publishes an article about previous class 12th toppers and what they are doing now; It mentioned the person who topped in 2007 and decided to take up animation for gaming industry as his major.

When my cousin showed this to his father, his reply was “What? He was all India topper! He had the right to choose whatever he wanted to become after doing engineering. Since he was good in maths and science he would be successful in animation too!” (Note ‘after doing engineering’)

Mind you, my cousin is actually good in creative stuff, he has created his own comics, animated videos, anime fan arts and is now learning gaming graphics. But still he has no right to choose this as he scored 60 in Maths. And anyone with 95% can take animation since he is a topper.

It was cold, the night arrived, it was dark, zero visibility but he still wanted to climb. Instead of taking a halt, he kept climbing.

Suddenly, his foot slipped and he lost his control. It was a free fall, he felt the pull of gravity. In those moments of great fear, it reminded of all the good and bad things he did in his life.

The voice came, “Will you do as I say?”

The man cried, “Yes anything, Please save me.”

The voice came, “Cut the rope tied on your waist.”

The man did not cut the rope and held it by all his strength.

Next morning when the rescue team arrived, it said that the climber was dead and frozen, he was holding on his rope which was frozen,

Only six feet above ground!

My father used to work as a Diamond worker in Surat. As life of diamond worker was not easy at that time. Before 4–5 months my father was fired from his job. After that he had started selling chocolates (To shopkeeper). My date of birth is 13th Aug. So i was very happy because i will get chance to give chocolates to my classmate. On 12-August, i was sleeping in room under blanket. I used to awake for an hour in bed. After sometime my father came home from work.

Mother : Tomorrow is Jaydeep’s birthday. So give me bag of chocolates.

Father: I can give you but..

Mother: But what ?

Father: One bag of chocolates will cost my one week earning.

My mother started crying. I was listening to them. I was only 9 year old at that time. I didn’t have much understanding of life but at that night i couldn’t sleep. I cried a lot. I started thinking that my father had not made 50 Rs. in last week whereas my school fee is 90 Rs. He is working whole day, selling chocolates on cycle, coming home at night only for his family.

This incident had changed me a lot.

I started working at local vadapav shop as a dish cleaner. Where i used to get 10 Rs. for whole day. but still i was happy because i can cover my school fees in just 9 days.

Me and my father both share difference of opinion (in each matter). We argued a lot but at the end, i do what, what he says because he might be wrong but he had done hard work to keep his family happy.

I never take change from small vendor and rickshaw driver after evening because i know what it feels when your father come home late after hard work.
I never celebrate my birthday because equivalent money spent on cake can feel empty stomach of some family.

I never waste food on my plate. I eat everything and i don’t have any food preferences.

I value money. For my family i book AC train & flight ticket but i travel in sleeper and general class whenever possible. I had gifted DSLR to my younger brother on his birthday but i don’t have any fancy gadgets for my self.

This might be small thing for somebody but this made me mature at very young age."
317,"What is maturity?
.
.
.

I have earned 3500 rupees in share market recently.

Two choices I had:
1. I am going goa in next week so I can use that money for me

2. My mom using old shoes for her gym So I want to gift her nike shoes.

One thought came to my mind :- whenever I want anything without any hesitation my parents gave me that thing by sacrificing their own need.

But they always lived simple life. So I have decided and you know what I have decided?

Definitely second option.

My point is always make your parents happy because you don't know how many sacrifices they have made for you.
I felt mature.
smile on my mom face is true treasure for me :)."

Who is the mentally strongest person you have ever met? 
. 
. 
. 

One of my student,Parminder Singh Arora,who is presently pursuing B.Tech from Jadavpur University.

His story in his own words -

“ I don’t remember having any childhood as such. I suddenly became 21 from 14 – there was a huge psychological gap in between. I was born and brought up in Calcuttta where I used to go to Khalsa English School. We used to live in Bhawanipore, and then we moved to Ludhiana, Punjab for two years. Meanwhile owing to an accident my father had become bedridden.

I had tremendous urge to study but we were financially unstable and the quality of education in the school my family could afford was below par. I badly wanted to come back to Calcutta. We did not have any money to buy our tickets. My mother struggled a lot to gather the money and I don’t know how, but she got three tickets for us to get back over here just for me. Nowadays, we talk a lot about true love – but the way my mother dared to take the leap of faith along with her paralyzed husband and twelve-year old son, it surpasses everything. She had no clue where to stay once we were back in the city or how we would feed ourselves. The only thing she knew was she had to make sure I got proper education. Ultimately we found accommodation in my brother-in-law’s residence in Bhawanipore.

My father's health deteriorated with time. I still remember my 10-year old self, standing beside my father in his deathbed as he failed to recognize anyone - apart from me. Even with his limited abilities he was able to gesture that I was his youngest son who was still in school.

Suddenly, I felt so matured after my father’s death because I knew that I had to take care of my mother. We were coping with the loss and gradually growing stable. I was in Class 8 when bhaiya died of a heart attack at a young age of 35. My sister-in-law and her two sons had to go back to Punjab. From Class 8, I had to work apart from going to school. Till Class 9, I worked as a tyre-delivery boy for 250 rupees. My school teachers were like My Protectors. From Class 6 till Class 10, my science teacher Ganesh Jha taught me without ever asking for tuition fees.

I topped in Madhyamik from my school. The only regret I have is that my mother never got to see this.10 days before my results she passed away in my arms in a taxi as we were rushing her to a hospital.

After my Class 10 finals, I took up Bhangra professionally. My first show got me 500 rupees. I used to earn more from shows outside the city. I started teaching mathematics to Class 9 students. There are a lot of sayings which tell us to follow our dreams. In my case, this actually came true. I wanted to do engineering as I wanted to fulfill my mother’s dreams. My life changed in half an hour when Aakash Institute waived a part of my fees and my school agreed to sponsor it. I started working as a waiter at a roadside Punjabi Dhaba near Deshapriya Park. One day, my Physics teacher from Aakash spotted me over there and it broke his heart. He helped me shift to a PG to carry on with my preparations and told me to give up work for one year. I studied with dedication for that year. I topped in Higher Secondary examination as well from my school.

I think we should never take our aims emotionally. I worked real hard before WBJEE as JEEMAINS did not go too well. I ranked around 1700. I got into JU in the first counseling and upgraded to Production Engineering. Currently, I am a Bhangra choreographer, a radio jockey at Radio Voice of Khalsa, an assistant Physics teacher at a CBSE school. My life does not allow me to think about future because you never can predict it. I want to take a break and do a job after completing my B.Tech. According to me, happy and sad are relative terms. And, none of it is permanent. Also, there are people living in better or worse conditions than you are. So, I think we should live life the way it comes.”"

Nicest tip that you've ever received..

It did not happen to me, but to a co-worker at Baskin Robbins with whom I worked for several years.  The happy recipient of this tip was a young lady named Janice.  At the time Janice was a struggling college student, much like many of us at the time, hoping to get through her education and be able to pay the bills.

Most afternoons Janice and I drew a shift from early afternoon until early evening.  An elderly man who lived nearby often stopped by and Janice was always kind and nice to him.  Actually we all were, but I think Janice really enjoyed hearing his stories, learning about his grandchildren, looking at photos, all of that.

Well, one day the regular customer stopped by for his scoop of ice cream.  He drove up in a brand spanking new Ford Mustang.  A really sweet ride.  Janice dashed out of the store and was hopping up and down, so happy that the man had bought himself something nice.  After eating his ice cream he advised Janice that he had decided to move to Florida.  Janice told him to enjoy the drive in his great new car.  The man shook his head, and pushed a set of keys and a pink slip across the counter.  ""This is for you"", he said.

After the normal number of protestations and incredulity, Janice was the proud owner of an absolutely brand new Mustang convertible.

That was a great tip.  Could not have happened to a nicer person."

323,"Q:- What is computer programming?

A:- A programmer was asked an interview question - If you had to construct a swimming pool for Mark Zuckerberg and had no budget limit to your project, describe the pool you will make?

Now this guy didn't have a clue about how swimming pools are made or what are the requirements for one. But his answer was what you can expect out of a programmer.

His answer - 
Let's consider the components here - A pool, a fountain nearby, a changing room, a bar, a resting/sunbathing area, and some other stuff rich people have by their pools. Since here we are referring only the pool, I will only describe the pool. Also since Mark loves Star Wars, this would be a Star Wars themed pool.

Let's consider the pool to be rectangular with a standard size of 16ft by 32ft.
Now for lights, there will be one  at every 4 ft along the perimeter. The colors of the lights will change if Mark decides to select Sith theme or a Jedi theme. On a closer look at the each of the light you will see a distinct star wars character on each of them, which will only be visible when you are close enough. The lights will also ..... **gets interrupted by the interviewer**

Interviewer - Let's move on to another question.

Programmer - But I haven't finished my answer sir....... in fact, I had barely started.

Interviewer(who was a wise man) - You don't need to, you're shortlisted for the next round.

Programming is about taking a problem (making the pool) and defining a solution to it(size of pool, lights, right down to each light) where every small detail is elaborated cause you are trying to convey it to the dumbest thing on a planet(a computer)."
324,"What is it that we as Indians are collectively doing wrong?
. 
. 
. 
. 
LINKEDIN, YOGA, TINDER. EDUCATION & STARTUPS.

1. LinkedIn - This whole bunch of “I am new to this” people with work description of over 500 words for an internship they did for 2 months. And the oh so pretty HR girls, with 500+ connections even though they dint work for over 7 months. Dear newbie HR, what if I told you, you could do your job, and even use linkedin, w/o having to make every random person your connection?

2. Yoga - Americans cant accept anything Indian, w/o putting their label on it. And we cant accept anything indian unless americans accept it already. So now, these random blonde chicks say “handstands”are a part of yoga, so we listen. They decide what is “yoga appropriate”clothing, and we listen. They create a “yoga mat” that is half the size of your waist, and now we cant do yoga without it. If you dont show off your tits / atleast your butt, its not even yoga!

3. Tinder - Half of them tell me how they are not here for “hookups.” I mean, you do realize that nobody even wants to hookup with you because you are that ugly, right? And the other half dont get the difference b/w random sex with a stranger and “friends with benefits.” Tinder is actually half instagram, and half linkedin. You get to see their pictures, and their designation… because nothing else matters.

4. Education - Even the british does not follow this shit anymore. Why are we so stuck up? Because Sonia Gandhi has ego issues and did not want to “restore”our education after all our gurus were murdered and libraries were burned? Why is “indology”a subject in germany, but not in india? Why am I not even told about it? I am not ignorant, nor are you. We are just lied to, constantly, by the whole god damn “WHITE”crew and our shitty media.

5. Startups - Now I know a few of them are doing good, or as they say, as per “Valuations,” which is the market value, and not the real economic value.. Which basically means its all inflated as hell. And just because IIT/IIM, people think they are smart… and first thing they do is get a company registered, and then make a Business plan, because thats how priorities work. Sigh!"
325,"My toddler asks ""why?"" to just about everything. How should I handle this?
. 
. 

I take inspiration from this chemistry professor:

SARAH: Daddy, were you in the shower?

DAD: Yes, I was in the shower.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: I was dirty. The shower gets me clean.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why does the shower get me clean?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: Because the water washes the dirt away when I use soap.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why do I use soap?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: Because the soap grabs the dirt and lets the water wash it off.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why does the soap grab the dirt?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: Because soap is a surfactant.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why is soap a surfactant?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: That is an EXCELLENT question. Soap is a surfactant because it forms water-soluble micelles that trap the otherwise insoluble dirt and oil particles.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why does soap form micelles?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: Soap molecules are long chains with a polar, hydrophilic head and a non-polar, hydrophobic tail. Can you say ‘hydrophilic’?

SARAH: Aidrofawwic

DAD: And can you say ‘hydrophobic’?

SARAH: Aidrofawwic

DAD: Excellent! The word ‘hydrophobic’ means that it avoids water.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why does it mean that?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: It’s Greek! ‘Hydro’ means water and ‘phobic’ means ‘fear of’. ‘Phobos’ is fear. So ‘hydrophobic’ means ‘afraid of water’.

SARAH: Like a monster?

DAD: You mean, like being afraid of a monster?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: A scary monster, sure. If you were afraid of a monster, a Greek person would say you were gorgophobic.

(pause)

SARAH: (rolls her eyes) I thought we were talking about soap.

DAD: We are talking about soap.

(longish pause)

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why do the molecules have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: Because the C-O bonds in the head are highly polar, and the C-H bonds in the tail are effectively non-polar.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Because while carbon and hydrogen have almost the same electronegativity, oxygen is far more electronegative, thereby polarizing the C-O bonds.

SARAH: Why?

DAD: Why is oxygen more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen?

SARAH: Yes.

DAD: That’s complicated. There are different answers to that question, depending on whether you’re talking about the Pauling or Mulliken electronegativity scales. The Pauling scale is based on homo- versus heteronuclear bond strength differences, while the Mulliken scale is based on the atomic properties of electron affinity and ionization energy. But it really all comes down to effective nuclear charge. The valence electrons in an oxygen atom have a lower energy than those of a carbon atom, and electrons shared between them are held more tightly to the oxygen, because electrons in an oxygen atom experience a greater nuclear charge and therefore a stronger attraction to the atomic nucleus! Cool, huh?

(pause)

SARAH: I don’t get it.

DAD: That’s OK. Neither do most of my students."

I'd only gone to the library to read a book recommended by a friend, but never in my wildest dreams had I thought that there'd be a blackout with a torrential downpour outside, and I'd be stranded with the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. She broke my reverie by sighing loudly. I walked up to her.

She (Sighing): ""Oh no!""

(The state of alertness which darkness engenders, brought out the spontaneous guy in me.)

Me (Curious): ""Are you afraid of ghosts?""
She: ""What? No......I mean..... I don't believe in such stuff!""

Me: ""Me too. But, I don't know why, whenever I am in an old, large, spooky, dark place like this and it's raining outside, the probability of existence of ghosts seems very high.""

She: ""Spooky, large, old, dark."" (She emphasized on each word.)
Me (Clueless): ""Huh? Yeah, that's what I just said.""

She: ""No! Your order of adjectives was wrong.""
Me (Digesting slowly): ""Order... of.... adjectives. Hmm. Is that what this place does to you?""

(She chuckled.)

She: ""Hi! I am Rose.""
Me: ""Rose. The noun or the verb?""

(She chortled again.)

She: ""Look, my parents were not that grammar conscious!""
Me: ""And look how you turned out!""

(We both laughed.)

Me: ""I am Aditya.""

(The librarian brought a candle. By the look on his face, he seemed as freaked out as me; watching two people talk in complete darkness. As opposed to ghosts, crazy people were very much real!)

Me: ""Well, I have heard about candlelight dinners, but candlelight reading sessions are new to me.""

She: ""Don't get any ideas, mister.""
Me: ""But I thought people came to libraries for ideas, for enlightenment!""

She: ""Funny of you to say 'enlightenment' during a blackout.""
Me: ""Hey! Let's not undermine the efforts of the candle. These babies have been very useful to people, you know; to help them bond, have romantic conversations.""

She (mischievously): ""Are you flirting with me?""
Me: ""Yeah. Rule No.1 of Professional Flirting: When you want to flirt with a girl, praise a candle instead!""

(She giggled.)

She: ""What are you reading?""
Me: ""Your eyes! The most beautiful pair I have ever seen. Now, I can see the flickering of the flame in them. Those glittering pearls have the power to make time stand still!""

She (overwhelmed): ""Wow! That is the most wonderful thing anyone has ever said to me. Now you are definitely flirting with me!""
Me: ""Well. I took the last line from the Sci-Fi book I am reading.""

(She laughed really hard.)

She: ""You plagiarist!""
Me: ""Hey! I just gave credit to the source!""

She: ""But you used it to try to impress me before mentioning that!""
Me: ""So you are impressed by me now?""

She: ""Didn't you hear the word 'try' ?""
Me: ""Okay, let's see, I am in this candle lit room alone, with a beautiful, intelligent girl who has a good sense of humor and it is raining outside.You can't blame me for trying. I am not a wuss!""

She: ""So what are you?""
Me: ""I am not a self-pompous person either. People are free to judge.""

She: ""Good. I like modest people. Especially, if they are smart and funny.""
Me: ""Were those compliments in disguise?""

She: ""Why do you need to convert my generalizations to attributions ?""
Me: ""Don't know. Why do you need to play games?""

(She giggled again and made a deep eye contact.)

She: ""I don't remember the last time I laughed so much.""
Me: ""Well, I hope you shall remember this time.""

(The power was back. The rain had also significantly receded.)

She: ""Okay. Time to go.""

(We prepared to leave. I went to the shelf to collect my bag.)

She: ""Hey! You dropped your bookmark here.""

I went back to the table and picked up the bookmark. I looked around. She was gone. I couldn't understand. Why had she gone away so abruptly? There was no mention of whether we could meet again. Not even a proper goodbye. I became morose.

I looked at the bookmark again.
There was something scribbled on it in a cute handwriting:

This was a room mate during my first semester in college. We were in a dormitory He had always seemed a touch strange and one day he suggested that we play pool for $20 per game. By that time I had won the college tournament to determine who was to represent Western State University at the intercollegiate championships. As we walked to the Grotto(the games area), I noticed him carrying a strange looking walking stick. As we got ready to play he made some adjustments on the cane and it became a pool cue. As it turned out he wasn’t much of a pool player and lost $180 and quit.

Later I asked him how was he able to afford a loss like that. He said that he had plenty of money, because he was well paid to work under cover for the CIA. From that point I decided that this was a guy who lived in a world of fantasy. A week and a half later I came back to our room and found his stuff missing. I mean like everything. No clothes, toiletries, no footwear, and nothing but a bare mattress on his bed. This was about 1:40pm, and he had been there in the morning. I assumed he had flunked out, but the departure seemed very strange. I went to the administration building to ask where he was, and if there would be a replacement. What replacement they wanted to know. You don’t have a room mate. I asked several different staff, and they all said the same thing. There was no record of any one else in that room.

I had no idea what the truth was, but at least I had a room to myself."

One day, I had been to the local police station for verification process of my passport. The Station Incharge was a good gentleman and was known to me. After the verification, He asked his staff to get tea for both of us and We started a small chit-chat.

By the time tea arrived, there was a call from the nearby government hospital informing him about 2 unclaimed dead bodies. He noted it on his diary and asked a junior to go to the hospital and get details.

After that, He asked if I will be willing to pay for the cremation of these unclaimed dead bodies. At first I could not understand. I had no idea, what He was talking about. He explained that every month, his police station (which is the authority for the largest government hospital in my state) gets about 1–2 unclaimed, unidentified dead bodies from the hospital. They have to arrange for the cremation of those dead bodies. The government doesn’t provide funds for that. They spend about Rs.1500 per cremation, which includes the cost of transporting the dead body to the cremation ground, wood, fuel, a Pandit (priest) and nominal fee for the person at the cremation ground to do the job. He said that they arrange for the money through donors in their contact (prospective one like me at that time). If they do not get someone to donate at any time, they dutch for the money among the staff members of the Police Station.

I was moved. I gave him my number and requested him to let me know about the cremation of any dead bodies in the future, so that I could contribute. It has been two years now, I am arranging for the cremation cost of the unclaimed, unidentified dead bodies. I say arranging, because I have made of small group of friends, who regularly contribute to this cause."

Back when I was in 9th grade, I had a huge crush on a girl who was studying in the 8th grade in the same school as mine. Somehow, with the help of friends I managed to get her home landline number. (mobile phones were not popular at that time)

Since the day I got her number, I used to dial her landline number from my landline number and whenever I had the luck of her answering the call, I used to listen to her angelic “Hello….. Hello……. Hellooooo"" :-D

Thankfully she didn't have a caller ID on her landline, so I happily continued this practice for quite some time (not frequent enough to encourage a police complaint) :-P

We had two phone instruments at our house for the same landline number. One was in the hall and the other one in my parents’ bedroom.

One fine day, I came back from school and decided to give her another blank call. After listening to her voice for some 4-5 seconds, I disconnected the call. To my horror, even after pressing the disconnect button on the phone, the call didn't get disconnected. I tried, tried and tried but I was not able to cut the call. My crush hadn't cut the call till now either. (I guess she was expecting a call from someone else probably her crush). So after trying to disconnect the call multiple times, the reason hit me and I literally froze at that moment. When I turned back I saw my mom had the other telephone instrument to her ear and she was listening to the entire one sided conversation. I immediately folded my hands and asked her to cut the call but she covered the mic on the handset with her hands and asked “Who is she? Shall I tell her your name? “. At this time, I was begging her with my hands and feet to please cut the call and I'll tell her the truth later. Finally she agreed.

After listening to a long lecture, she blackmailed me into buying groceries for the entire week from the market myself in return of not telling dad about it. :-("

“I saved my relationship using an application called ‘Tasker’”

Yes, I have automated my Whatsapp to send ‘Sorry’ , ‘I love you’ and couple of other messages every 15 seconds for 7 hours straight to my girl friend.

Short background: Being a classic nerd I were, my girlfriend used to complain how I don’t put any time or effort in our relation and always keep working on my interests. One day we had a big argument on the similar lines which made her very angry and upset. I was someone who believes in showing love by being supportive and helping out in important things in life rather than doing cheesy/romantic stuff (later on I learnt there should be a healthy mix of both for a happy relation :P). I decided to apologize her by sending some texts but my past experiences have taught me that single sorry’s and ‘I love you’ s will be reverted with extremely dangerous ‘K’/’hmm’/’GTH’ etc. Then this amazing application called ‘Tasker’ came to my mind which can do hell lot of things based on ones imagination. What it does is automate/schedule the things you manually need to do like ‘Opening an application’ ‘Typing a message’ ‘Switching off WiFi’ etc. I have written a code such that it opens the application, search my GF’s name and send pre-written texts in specified intervals. After tens of iterations and approximately an hour, finally I came out with the perfect code that sends a message every 15 seconds from 11:30 P.M. to 6:30 A.M. Voila!!

I scheduled them and had sound 8 hour sleep which got disturbed by my GF’s phone calls. She is pleasantly surprised by thousands of messages and was extremely happy that finally I learnt how to show affection by putting effort i.e. typing all the messages by being awake all night. I buried that fact in myself just in case I have to use it sometime later :D Men will be men after all I guess."

Rickshaw pullers are very common in Northern India.

Though a Rickshaw can take 2 people max, but the Indians to save money try to fit 2-4 people in that small Rickshaw and they fight at the end they fight with those pullers and give less money to save 10 rupee.

My mother is a government employee when she married my dad who is a driver. They married against their parents will. All I could remember about my childhood was one thing. My father getting drunken and beating my mom badly. He later quit his job and became completely parasitic. Even with all these hardships our mother managed to send us to the best school in the town where the school fee is almost equal to her earnings. She taught us that education is the most essential thing in life and never quit it. In class 7 my father expired of some health issues because he was a chronic alcoholic. The body was taken to his village. I still remember that day June 19  as soon as we got down of the vehicle relatives from my father's side grabbed my mother's hair and beat her badly. Me and my sister who is in class 2 couldn't comprehend what was happening. They blamed my mother for my father's death. In spite of all her service to my sick father she was treated badly by those people who never gave damn about us. Three of us(mom, me and my sister) were not allowed to even see my dad's body. We were made to stand(near the tree where they usually make judgement, kind of gramapanchayat) for the whole day and back at my father's home all the rituals for burial were taking place. After all he is our father and when my mom explained my sister that we will never be able to see our dad again my sister being 7 years old begged them that she wanted to give papa one last kiss but they showed no mercy on us. After the burial was over everyone came to us and cursed as much as they can. They took of all the gold three of us are wearing saying that it was their sons hard earned money. They beat me for protesting them while beating my mom. That night we were locked in a store room when my mother's friends and colleagues came to rescue us. Thank god we have atleast them this is what I felt. That whole thing changed our life. We were rock hearted and scared for nothing. Me and my sis decided that we should work hard and make mummy proud of us. And today am a dentist and my sister got into medical college. My mom is proud. Even now we have many issue's and problems but we are strong enough to face them and never lose our cool. After all it's nothing compared to that day."

It's been one year since I was selected in the service. Many a times i have talked to the people; young and old, preparing for upsc or even those not knowing anything about what the service is all about, all asking a same question:-
IS BEING AN IAS WORTH THE RIGOUR OF UPSC??

I recently came across the following incident which answered this rather simple looking but difficult question.

A young IAS officer undergoing training in the Gurdaspur district of Punjab was asked to verify the beneficiaries of the ""Old Age Pension scheme"". It included removing fake beneficiaries from the list and including the deserved ones.

The officer decided to go to a village herself to see the verification process. A very old lady in her 70's and who apparently had some difficulty in walking came to the officer and requested her that her name be included in the list. The officer was appalled to see that the old lady name was not in the list. The following conversation that took place in Punjabi then followed:-
""Why is your name not in the list in the first place.?"" The officer asked
""Because I have no proof of my age beta""
""Mata g.. kuch to hoga.. AADHAR, any govt. Scheme card?""
""No beta, nothing. Please help me as this pension money is the only source of money I can afford to have""
The IAS officer thought for a moment and then asked,""okay mata g..please tell if anybody in your house has got any government card made where his/her age is mentioned.""

The lady's son who was standing nearby immediately said,""yes mam, I have my AADHAR card with me.""
His AADHAR card was seen where his age was clearly written as 55 years.

The officer gave a smile and using her discretion asked her team to include the old lady's name in the list of beneficiaries on the basis of the AADHAR card of her son and some other paperwork. Also she instructed the authorities present there to use their common sense in such cases.

The old lady felt so happy. She went inside and brought 11 rs. and tried to give it to the officer as a token of her blessings by saying
"" jug jug jio beta""
The officer gave that money to her little great grand daughter playing nearby. 

It was a moment marked with the joy of the lady, a feeling of satisfaction for job well done for the officer and a pleasant surprise for the people who have gathered around.

Chandler.

The reason is very simple. He was the most relatable.

Joey wanted to be an actor, he became an actor. Monica aspired to be a chef. She did that. Rachel and Ross too did what they loved. Poor Chandler was the one stuck in a shitty job like most of us, with no idea what he did, why he did. He also didn't have an idea about what he really wanted.

He was also horrible with women (like most of us), gynophobic in the beginning. Phoebe even considered him to be gay at one point. Then he fell in love with Monica and evolved to be the best life partner one could have. Understanding, loving and matured.

He was also a great friend, ask Joey. He took care of his best friend for years, never wanting his money back.

As funny as it sounds, he was the sanest of them all too.

Ross and Rachel were both mental. Monica was OCDic. Phoebe was Phoebe and Joey was just a good looking dumb kid.

Chandler, despite a horrible childhood and not a great adulthood kept his mind in place.

Cheers. :-)"

Me: I don't know why buddy, there could be lots of reasons.

Son: like what?

Me: sometimes bad things happen to people and they lose their money and job so they can't afford a house to live in.

Son: if that happens to me couldn't I just stay at your house till it's ok again.

Me: of course you could mate, but some people don't have mums and dads to look after them like we look after you.

Son: because they are dead?

Me: usually yes, there may be other reasons though.

Son: won't the government be like their dad and let them sleep somewhere better?

Me: yes mate there are plenty of places that will help people who have no home. Some people have mental problems that make them scared of asking for help. Some have other problems that mean they can't stay there too. The point is that we won't know unless we talk to each person and ask them what is wrong and how to help them.

Son: can we help him dad?

Me: do you want to give him your pocket money buddy?

Son: will it buy him a house?

Me: no mate but it might buy him something to eat.

Son: can we take him to lunch with us please dad?

I learned something from my little 5 year old that day and we both learned a lot from that homeless man too. We took him to lunch with us and my son asked him all about his life and how he ended up on the street.

He told me as we parted ways that nobody had ever cared about him the way my son had, he gave my little man a lock of his beard to remember him by, my son put it in his money box to “save the meeting”"

Quora manipulates opinion.

Yes, it does. My subconscious mind starts creating an opinion about anything or a person and I start hating it or loving it. Recently I was watching television and there played a song of Katrina kaif. I immediately changed the channel. I like that song but I changed the channel. I thought for a while and found out that I hate Katrina kaif in that song so I changed the channel.

I have read all the answers to the question “How is Katrina kaif in real life.” The answers are all negative, she is rude, she is bad, she is this and that. This has created an opinion in my mind. I have never met her, never experienced her personally then why should I hate her? Same thing I have observed about Mr. Modi. I don't hate him. But he has been made hero by all the answers on Quora.

They might be right but structuring an opinion out of it is not worth. Please analyze everything before creating an opinion."

Michael Jordan. 

Michael Jordan was an African-American man, born in 1963, in the slums of Brooklyn, New York.

He had four brothers and his father's wages were not sufficient to provide for the whole family.

He grew up in a poor neighborhood which was full of discrimination, to the point where he could not see any hope for the future.

When he was 13 years old, his father gave him a piece of used clothing and asked: ""What do you think the value of this outfit would be?""

Jordan replied, ""Maybe one dollar.""

His father asked, ""Can you sell it for two dollars? If you can sell it, it would mean that you are a big help to your father and mother. ""

Jordan nodded his head, ""I'll try, but no guarantee that I'll be successful.""

Jordan carefully washed the clothes clean. Because they didn't have an iron, to smoothen out clothes, he levelled it with a clothes brush on a flat board, then kept it in the sun to dry. The next day, he brought the clothes to a crowded underground station. After offering it for more than six hours. Jordan finally managed to sell it for $2. He took the two dollar bill and ran home.

After that, everyday he was looked for used clothing, washed and ironed it and sold it in the crowd.

More than ten days later, his father again gave him a piece of used clothing, ""Now think of a way that you can sell these clothes for 20 bucks?""

Jordan said, ""How is it possible? This outfit can only fetch two dollars at the most. ""

His father replied in an effort to inspire him, ""Why don't you try it first? There must be a way.""

Finally, Jordan got an Idea He asked for cousin's help to paint a picture of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse on the garment. Then he tried to sell it in the school where the children of the rich study. Soon a housekeeper, who was there to pick his master, bought clothes for his master. The master was a little boy of only 10 years but was very fond of clothes. He loved it so much and he gave a five dollar tip. 25 dollars was a huge amount for Jordan, the equivalent of a weeks salary of his father.

When he got home, his father gave him yet another piece of used clothing. ""Are you able to resell it at a price of 200 dollars?"" His eyes lit up.

This time, Jordan accepted the clothes without the slightest doubt. Two months later a popular movie actress from the movie ""Charlie's Angels"", Farah Fawcett came to New York for her Movie promos. After the press conference, Jordan made his way through the security forces to reach the side of Farah Fawcett and requested her autograph on the piece of clothing. When Fawcett saw this innocent child asking for her autograph, she gladly signed it.

Jordan was shouting very excitedly, ""This is a jersey signed by Miss Farah Fawcett, the selling price is 200 dollars!""He auctioned off the clothes, to a businessman for a price of 1,200 dollars!

Upon returning home, his father by broke into TEARS and said, ""I am amazed that you did it My child! You're really great! ""

That night, Jordan slept alongside his father. His father said, ""Son, in your experience selling these three pieces of clothing, what did you learn about success?""

Jordan replied, ""Where there's a will, there's a way.""

His father nodded his head, then shook his head, ""What you say is not entirely wrong! But that was not my intention. I just wanted to show you that a piece of used clothing which is worth only a dollar can also be increased in value, Then how about us - living & thinking humans? We maybe darker and poorer, but what's the difference? ""

This thought enlightened young Jordan. Even a piece of used clothing could be made dignified, then why not me? There is absolutely no reason to underestimate myself.

From then on, Michael Jordan felt that his future would be beautiful and full of hope.

Our potential is so great, and should not be viewed small & low only because of our status, looks or wealth. Even a diamond is just a stone before it has been polished.

You basically love your freedom SO MUCH that you think it's too much of an effort. That streak of fierce independence shines brightly in you. This also explains why you prefer to travel alone. 

2. You think before you speak.

This means you often regret why you said something to someone in such and such tone. Being asked, ""Why are you so quiet?"" is no big deal!

3. You secretly realize that most of what most people speak most of the time is BS.

Needless to say, you dislike small talk with a passion! You wonder when you last talked about sports or the weather.

4. You hate being in groups.

More specifically, you object to the induced restriction in movements of your neck and head imposed by the spatial orientation of group members. You would like to move out of the group as soon as your interest in the conversation is over. By the way, WhatsApp groups are no exception!

5. Your Room Is Your Country.

The longing for the home is ever there! After school or college or work, you're the first one to head to the HOME SWEET HOME! 

You just don't have the need to hang out with your friends especially in crowded places. A laptop and a pyjama are all you need for a day's happiness.

6. You observe your mind like people observe the world.

3.  Arrogance:  I refuse to associate with anyone who can't tie their own shoes.

What is an incident that changed your life?
.

Meeting Him!

It was 1980, Guwahati and I was the 15 year old daughter of a rickshaw puller - Actually a school teacher who was forced out of his town, profession, lineage, country by '72 war and took to the job of a rickshaw puller like many other teachers, bankers, businessmen who had lost everything to the war. The slums of Guwahati were brimming with “Bangladeshi” immigrants who took new jobs, degrading jobs, quickly forgetting who they were. Hunger does it to you and when it does, trust me, it takes just a few minutes to accept your new life.

My father died; tuberculosis coupled with inhuman labor took just five years to reduce him to a tiny skeleton, and in a way his death was a relief for me. I could not see him struggling to carry fat aunties to the Mandis coughing blood. But the relief was short, so was the grief because hunger subdues all other emotions a person can have and reduce him/her to an ‘it’- an animal. I was not good at house hold tasks and my father had me read books than cleaning utensils back in Purbabanga (Thats what we called Bangladesh back then). My aunt, a cousin of my dead mother, slowly began to refuse the single bowl of rice she used to offer. I was helpless, I was clueless and I let myself being guided by the only emotion I knew- Hunger. Sheikh bhai took me to Nasima Begum who ran a brothel in paltan bazaar area.

When I realized what was that, I was horrified. I was just fifteen and knew nothing about sex. But looking back, I feel grateful, for Nasima in her own ways consoled me. She helped me with the tricks of the trade and the first night of that dark journey began. I sobbed as day after day, men after men paraded into that tiny bamboo chamber - drunk men, men stinking of potatoes, perfumed rich marwaris, and it went on and on. Nasima was kind to let me keep 40% of the money I earned, 20% of which I paid back as rent and catering charges. But I had no family, no future and no dreams to live for, so I spent my remaining 20% on things that I loved most - Books. Books of Shankar, Sarat Chandra, William Golding etc. filled my shelf, watching over my sweaty body which I used to buy more of those. The customers that came to me, all frowned at me for my “nasty” habit, and I kept on ignoring.

One day when I was waiting for my first customer of the day, I saw him walking hesitantly inside the rickety house. I knew he was a first timer the moment I saw him. He was tall and like all tall boys back then he wore a bell bottom. He was accompanied by his friends, 3–4 boys of the same age. One of the boys, his friend, who was acting very smart pointed to me and said,

“****** get her, you deserve the youngest tonight”. He shoved the tall man whose name I learnt to be ****** towards me. He was unsure whether he wanted to do this and I lost no time to pull him to my cottage. Such customers were most sought after as in most cases they did not harass you and were way gentle than the regular street thugs that frequented the brothel.

“You have read Fountainhead?!”

He asked with wide eyes eyeing at the copy of a book I got two weeks back. I nodded and proceeded to undress. He stared at me with lust if I remember correctly and suddenly that expression changed into something else. He asked me to sit beside him and he started asking questions about me. I said things, about the slums and my father, and he kept pressing for more information. He could not believe that the daughter of a rickshaw puller would spend a fortune to get a book mail delivered from abroad.

He just set there and spoke about himself. That day was his first day in the job and hence the celebration in a 'brothel'. But there was a guilt in him for having to pay money for sex.I wondered what was the source of the sudden guilt. I thought it could be the realization that there was a prostitute in the brothel who understood the moral dilemmas, ethics and principles of the world that belonged to the rich and the educated. But surprising me, he visited again a week after. Then he visited more frequently, always looking for me. And we talked all night. About his family, his father struggling with cancer and my life back in Purbabanga. Nasima became anxious as I was not earning her much. So he paid the balance to buy my company. Somebody paid for my company and not my body, and that realization made me feel for him in a different way. I was even bold enough to call it love but it would not take seconds to dismiss it. What right to love does a prostitute have? By now you must have predicted, one day he proposed and married me after a long fight with his family. I tried my best to fit in a society long forgotten. I had issues, pity, sympathy, even abhorrence from people for my past. But I moved on. I completed my education and am now teaching English in a government school. Right now, I am typing this answer from a tablet gifted to me by my daughter, sitting in the patio of our own house in a respectable neighborhood. I owe this future to my husband and that evening when he met me. *******, I hope you can read this answer from amidst the sky and know that I Love You."

A guy got up around that time and looked out of the window. There was a park you could see from the second floor that we were on and he could see the missing friend running around in the park really fast. He shrugged and went back to bed.

355,"Study hacks. 

ONE. Create a morning habit to give your energy for the day ahead.

You can be on top of your game by following a morning routine so that you accomplish more early, which in turn can motivate you to be even more productive throughout the rest of the day. A routine gives you structure and breaks down your morning hours into smaller chunks of work that are easier to do. I recommend listening to a podcast called Achieve Your Goals with Hal Elrod, the author of a book called The Miracle Morning. If you'd like some more tips on creating a morning routine, read more about it here.

TWO. Feed your brain right.

Start your day with a balanced breakfast, for example with a combination of protein, fruits, and healthy fats (such as nuts): it can be oatmeal or yogurt with granola, fresh fruit, walnuts and almonds.
Have an egg! Eggs are a powerful mix of B vitamins (they help nerve cells to burn glucose), antioxidants (they protect neurons against damage), and omega-3 fatty acids (they keep nerve cells functioning at optimal speed).
Did you know that some excellent brain food includes sardines, beets, spinach, and lentils? Try to incorporate these and other foods into your daily meals to boost your brain power.

THREE. Do your deep work early.

Deep work is what your analytical brain does that requires a lot of concentration to perform the most complex tasks (in the case of studying, these can be reading, comprehension, application, repetition). Some scientists call this time of day the brain’s peak performance time, and it's roughly 2-4 hours after we wake up. So, for example, if you wake up at 6, your peak times are between 8 and 10 a.m. Be sure to block this time off to cover your most important work, and leave other activities such as checking your Facebook and Instagram updates, your emails, and the news for later in the day.

FOUR. Become a time management pro.

When you're ready to start studying, use a timer to divide up your day into manageable increments that will allow your brain to focus in a more targeted and effective way. You can set the timer to 30 or 60 minute blocks, for example. You can also try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks. When you're done with one segment, step away from your desk, and do something completely unrelated to work to give your brain a chance to rest: take a 5 minute walk, stretch your body, grab a cup of coffee or tea.

FIVE. Take a power nap.

To boost your concentration and cognitive abilities, take a nap for about 30 minutes in the afternoon; find a comfortable space (a couch, an armchair, your bed). Block away environmental noise with noise-cancelling headphones. If you prefer, you can listen to music that can help you relax (anything that is instrumental; it can be classical music, chillout, sounds of nature).

SIX. Take a walk.

Performing some form of physical exercise, even if it is targeted and short, improves your brain's cognitive performance, problem solving ability, and even boosts long-term memory. Aim for 30-45 minutes. If your neighborhood or college campus is noisy, take your headphones with you and listen to some relaxing instrumental music.

SEVEN. Use your evening for strategic thinking.

This is typically the time of day when the brain slows down, doesn't go at top speed to adhere to deadlines, so it has space for more creative thinking. Use this time for activities such as:

Setting study goals for the week
Strategizing how to optimize your learning (find new learning tools or apps)
Reviewing your schedule for the next day
Contemplating the big picture with these questions:
Where you would like to be once you've completed your exams?
What are your long term goals?
What is the career you want for yourself?
What are the steps you'll need to take to get started on the next phase of your professional development?

EIGHT. Train your brain to be calmer.

So much information to absorb, so many details to remember, and all those tough deadlines to adhere to. Studying is hard! You can help your brain by training it with meditation. This practice can help you deal better with the input of information that could lead to feelings of chaos, overwhelm, and stress.Start with just 10 minutes. Download the Headspace app; it makes meditation easy, fun, and great for beginners.

NINE. Use a nighttime routine to unwind faster and get ready to sleep.

This habit will help you ease away from your studies and signal to your body that it's time to slow down and prepare for rest. You can (a) set a bedtime alarm to go off 30 minutes before going to sleep, (b) stay away from electronics (mainly your computer), (c) stretch your legs with a short walk after dinner for about 20-30 minutes to boost digestion and give your brain some extra oxygen, and (d) do something relaxing before bedtime: read a book, listen to music, or just close your eyes and breathe deeply for 10 counts before you brush your teeth and get ready for bed."

Watching movies, cricket, serials, songs, porn etc.
Reading novels and newspapers.
Masturbation, sex etc.
Surfing social websites like facebook.
Doing anything which is fun but does not involves you intellectually or creatively.
Now, why should you avoid passive entertainment? Because they tame you. They give you joy and keep you going with a life that sucks. You first get brainwashed during your day and work, and when you finally have time for introspection or thinking, you compensate the bad day through passive entertainment which makes your sucking life a little comfortable and you find a reason to live. You get tamed by society and its expectations. You work hard during day and watch porn in free time. You compensate. You do not revolt.

Or maybe you do. That is why you posted this question.

Now, what will happen when you give up passive entertainment? You initially feel emotional shocks. You were addicted to passive entertainment, bollywood-hollywood bullshit too much. But slowly, you will become stable. Your life will appear before your eyes in its untinted ugly form, as mine appears before my eyes. But without stimulations from passive entertainment, your life will suck more. There will be no joy, no passive entertainment, no reason to live.

And then, you will have to find the reason. You will start doing small things that give you joy. If you loved trekking before, you will become crazy about it. If you loved painting before, you will start spending nights doing it. If you loved mathematics, your brain will start storming with ideas.

People will start calling you lunatic, but that’s what they call all extraordinary people.

Give up passive entertainment. Find out yourself. The real one."

This is what Rachit Raj IAS (3rd rank in CSE 2013) had posted on his FB page..and it really inspired me, so I'm sharing his post here!

Recently I read many articles flooded on social media regarding Bihar election results, person becoming ministers, education level etc.
And then I'm also reading that secretary/ IAS/IPS etc. will have to report him/her etc.

And this reminded me of the lecture given by our present Hon'ble President; Shri Pranab Mukherjee.

He in a lecture said that in 1970's he asked an IAS officer who was secretary that time that despite so much of studies, qualification and all you are standing before me and I am sitting on the chair. I am not that qualified and enriched like you but still you are reporting me every thing and without my permission you are not even sitting. He said that he himself is not that qualified and you are, but still this scenario!

That particular officer at that time gave a very good reply.
The officer said that, ""Sir, I am respecting the chair on which you are sitting. Sir, I am respecting the feelings, opinion and hope of millions of people who have elected you. I am not respecting you but I am respecting those millions of citizen. India being a democratic country, here the government is for the people, by the people and of the people. So ultimately it's the people who are ruling. So it's the mandate whom I am respecting and following.

This answer is even valid today and particularly holds true."

I knew I had hit rock bottom. This was the lowest point in my life. Laying there in the middle of the road, soaking in my own blood, something hit me on a very fundamental level.
I had absolutely nothing, which means I had nothing more to lose.

I decided to pull it up with the little resources i had. I took one cloth clip, tied a long thread to the clip and put some ice between the clip like this(in pic)

Then i dropped the clip over the shirt and maneuvered it in such a way that some piece of cloth was in between the mouth of clip. And then i waited for the ice to melt, after which clip clutched one of the corner of my shirt. Slowly i pulled the thread and grabbed my shirt as soon as i could reach it.

She looked at me with that funny quizzical worried look on her face and said “hey, we better get out of here” and we took off with the attendant’s asking me if she was OK. My girlfriend just kept walking fast, a few paces ahead of me, and when we got outside the theatre she said ”look, look, I’m not dead”.

1. Lectures:- Never ever lecture men in front of other guys,never ever yell at them in front of other guys or girls for not picking up the call or something else.(In case you are married never shout or insult your man in front of his parents or any relatives.)

2.  Beauty:- Na h! It doesn't matter whether a woman is super hot or super successful . They need a girl who has manners ,whom they can bring home to meet his mother or father ,or any other relatives of his family. ( They look for a girl who knows when to wear saree and when to wear short skirts.).

3.  Language:- If you use foul or abusive words ,stop using to some extent ,you may get used to such words . Avoid it. Chances are there you might speak that word in front of his parents. You never know.

4.  Judging:- Never judge all men by one man's action.
Face and body:- Never go for men looks or attractive physique. Beauty will fade . In case you always demand branded things from your boyfriend let me tell you (you won't get branded ""Kafan"").

5.  Personal life:- Don't keep searching their internet history or asking to his friend about your man past relationships, don't force your man to give his Quora or Facebook password to you. Give them some space.

6.  Job / Studies:-Whatever job or studies your guy is doing. Let him do. Never say ""your job sucks ""or "" you have no future in this "". If he needs your advice he will ask . So just chill.

7.  Motivation:- Never demotivate them. Encourage and support them to take risks, in taking challenges.

8. Yelling:- Don't yell at them for not remembering your love anniversary, not wishing you birthday exactly at 12, or not giving you gifts .

9.  Emotions;-Men are emotional. They too have gone through emotional scars,broken hearts,abuse and sleepless nights. YES they cry.

10. They like women who can be their friend first and girlfriend later, avoid makeups.

11. Sometimes they need financial support too. You never know sometimes they have to face lots of tragic situation. (Girls in case you have money phobia you love money more than any other thing, you want your bf to pay for everything then remember one thing ,your son will be the next victim).

12.  If they don't want to chat 24 *7, don't force them please.

I once boarded a crowded bus. The conductor was having a really bad day. I gave him a 100 rupee note for a 7 Rs ticket because I did not have change. He lost his cool and gave me a rude and nasty comment. I just looked at him, smiled and told him I was sorry that I did not carry change. After half an hour, when I was getting down at my destination, he apologized.

People are not bad by nature. People are not bad always. Certain situations make them act in a way that is not pleasant. If you are nice to such people, it gives them some time to introspect and reflect on their actions. More often than not, people realize their mistake and correct themselves."

I met someone who was working as a maid at a friends house.

Cleaning scrubbing, fetching water. And my friend was kind of hard on her. Super hard, actually.

I felt sorry for her.  And so , in a moment of ""niceness"" I found her a job elsewhere.  Whatever task she was given she would accomplish it in a quarter of the time given  - without any fanfare.  I realised she was a natural organizer and very gifted and efficient  administrator, despite her circumstances and confines.

It may sound strange to say this in such an American forum, but the truth is her trajectory would have continued to be within this sphere.  From maid job to maid job forever. Because she wasn't educated and had no ""real"" track record. And, after all, this is a continent of hustlers, all trying so hard to survive.

This lady had not even completed basic education, but I took her on as an office cleaner in my struggling new business.  Secretly I needed the cleaner to be able to be more... I couldnt pay more! I neded someone who could clean and also be basic admin person. But if all failed, I was willing and able to do it myself.

But.... I just believed in her and liked her.  Her confidence was at such a low it was a struggle to even convince her she could have her own email account.  She didnt think she was able to.

But then she started to believe in herself. And when she did , she soared.

And as my own business transformed, alot of friends kept suggesting I needed to hire up,  find a ""real"" bookkeeper.  but.... I  believed she had potential.  At some point I realised, despite her basic education, she had an incredible mind for numbers and figures.

Today, 10 years on she is the one of the most valuable people on my small team. Maybe in a weird way THE most valuable

She pays me back in ways that I cannot describe here. I trust her beyond trust and the instinct I had about her skill with figures and accounts has some to pass. She is amazing. Our qualified accountants CANNOT believe she didn't study. Her daughter, who is now 14 loves physics.  Her older son works.

My biggest payback is seeing her kids able to attend great schools and flourish  and make their mom proud. And I love that she is a vital and important part of the work I do now - and gets paid well for it. She is the first one in and last one out each day. The full and part time employees we have call her ""Mom"".

I'm so grateful I gave her a break - because I know for sure if we had not connected,  I would be struggling to find someone as amazing as her but wouldn't know how."

I don't grow my nails.
No, it isn't because I am a small-town girl who doesn't know how to look presentable, but because I can't maintain.

I am a girl who doesn't like wearing jewelry.
No, it isn't because I am tomboyish, but because I find beauty in simplicity.

I have completed my graduation and am earning quite a decent salary.
No, I am not marrying because it's the right age. I don't care what YOU think is right for me. I'm marrying because I want to settle down with my best friend.

I do not dream for a ""Prince Charming"".
Not because I am a realistic person, but because I am human, and I would be comfortable with someone as human as me.

I don't like to cook.
No, it isn't because I am a modern-day woman who thinks cooking is beneath her, but because I have absolutely no interest in it.

I love.
No, it isn't to get love back in return, but because love calms me.

I don't gossip.
No, it isn't because I think it is wrong to gossip, but because I enjoy my own company and I have least interest in others' lives.

I don't talk much.
No, it isn't because I am weak or feeble, but because I am a keen observer.

I laugh out loud.
No, it isn't because I am manner-less, but because I love laughing.

I menstruate.
No, I do not like discussing it with people; not because I think of it as taboo, but only because it is a private thing for me.

I go to religious places or ceremonies even when I am supposedly 'impure'.
No, it isn't to disrespect Gods, but only because I have a logical and rational mind.

I don't go to temples frequently.
No, it isn't because I am an atheist, but because I actually believe that God is omnipresent.

I am flat-footed, one of my legs is a tiny bit shorter than the other, my arms are thin, I have an extremely piercingly shrill voice, and I have slightly crooked toes.

Maturity allows you to take charge of your life. You can create a happy, healthy life when you respect yourself first.

“What do you mean? Wouldn’t you rather get a gift that lasts?” he asked me confusedly.

“Yes, but it’s not always about how long it lasts. It’s about the gesture. Anyway, you have no problems giving chocolate as gifts. And they certainly don’t last. But they are definitely appreciated!”

“Yeah you’ve actually got a point there.” he mused.

From being jobless in 2013 to 40 lakhs an year, and growing :) 

I graduated from one of the ""best"" colleges in D.U.- CBS earning my bachelors in 2014. I had to graduate in 2013, but because of one stupid paper in which I flunked,  I had to give the exams next year but was not required to attend college for a single day. Quite obvious, I wasn't able to secure a good job ( paying more than 4 lpa in a college where average is 5.6 with the likes of BAIN,  McKinsey coming to hire for research based roles) despite having fantastic extra curriculars and above average aptitude ( as reflected in my cat scores). In January 2014, I started going to my dad's office, who is a small scale jeans wholesaler, just to pass time. For six months,  I just went there not contributing anything to the business but just going there. My dad's business was really small scale,  and there was not much to do even for him. Instead of one,  there were two people earning the same money. My dad has tonnes of experience but for some reason he wasn't able to cash in on his experience.  

Then in August 2014, I started selling online- starting with jeans manufactured by my father on snapdeal and flipkart not putting any extra money.  The first six months, we didn't make much sales till February but after that I understood the tricks of the trade.  
In March 2015,  I stopped bottomwear and started selling suits and blazers (which was totally a new thing for both me and my dad)  on all leading marketplaces- sourcing from a local fabricator.  What's notable is, to start this business which in the beginning too had a potential of one lakh income per month , we didn't put in a SINGLE paise. Usually,  in the traditional wholesale business,  to have a dhandha of one peti a month ( one lakh) sales of a crore is needed and to generate that,  usually 25 lakhs is put in because in the deep credit market,  your money can make at most four circulation in an year.  

We convinced him to make the blazers for our firm when the order came and deliver it to our shop within 36 hours. Business took off,  and in August,  we set up our own factory doing half the manufacturing work in-house.  By January 2016,  we had set up our own Internet store,  we're selling on all Indian marketplaces and expanded to amazon USA and UK.  

The turnover in the financial year was 1.5 crore with 40 lakhs margin. I made more money than all my classmates and even the ones who did MBA from the likes of IIMs.  All this without an additional investment from my father, but definitely not without his guidance and support. My father couldn't cash on his experience,  but I could and I did.  We run our company as a private limited company with me and my dad as the directors.  
This year we are targeting 3 crore in revenues.

The false accusation of rape.

At the age of 26, I was in a relationship with a girl (24 years). We loved spending time with each other. She seemed to be the perfect partner. But I got busy with work and couldn't meet her as much. The only option was to hangout during weekends. 
One day when I visited her during weekend, she looked uncomfortable and was engrossed into her mobile screen, chatting with someone. In the kitchen I saw men's clothes. She stayed alone, so I asked her. She stammered a lot and gave a senseless reply. The phish was going in some other way.

Then it happened. I remember that date, 29th October 2010, the black day of my life. I caught my GF with some other guy. The moment he saw me, he started beating her. There were bruises all over her body. I was enraged and punched him. But the guy being stronger beat me to a point I felt dizzy. He ran away. The next thing, I was scolding her for cheating on me. She said she doesn't like me anymore. She threatened me not to tell this to anyone. I disagreed and left.

But this b"""""""" called her parents and told them that I raped her. She showed them her torn clothes (the guy did). Her dad contacted the police without knowing the complete matter. Then I see, four policemen at my doorstep, who handcuff and arrest me. I was taken to the police station. My parents were informed. I was beaten to third degree torture. I was forced to plead guilty. But I didn't. Soon this news spread right from my relatives to my workplace. As a result I lost my job. I lost my dignity. Do you know how accused are treated by the court and the police? Other prisoners would see an opportunity to kill you while keeping you alive.

There I was eating the worst food in the world, that of the prison. Making rounds of the court. Going through trauma. Seeing my mum cry whenever she saw me and my dad hopeless in getting back his son. This news never made it to the national media. I am thankful for that.

Finally evidence was proved. The court ruled in my favor and I was set free. Those 2 months of my life affected me the most. I was diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and BDD syndrome. I started losing my memory. As a result, I got isolated from the society and turned to alcohol. My parents took me to various doctors and rehab centers and finally after 3 years of pursuit I quit alcohol. But certain wounds in your life never heal.

I still get panic attacks occasionally. While writing this answer, I am shivering with tears in my eyes. I no longer work. I get out of home only once in a month for shopping. After the incident, I disconnected from all female friends in my group. I have become so paranoid that if in a public transport I never sit besides a female. This one thing changed my perception so much that it's 5+ years now and I shall stay single for the rest of my life.

Because life taught me that ""Straight trees are cut first and nice people are accused the most"".

EDIT: I see many Indians saying this isnt the procedure. This didn't take place in India. For the time being I cannot reveal my country and lot more details in the answer. To avoid confusion I am removing the aftermath part. I shall find a better person who can write it much better and add it in edit later.

Regarding if my story is fake or not, I leave it to you. Because what I've gone through will not change by your belief. Sorry :("

Lady 2: Bahu to bahut buri hai, roz late uthti hai, mera beta uske liye chai banata hai, Ghar ka koi kaam nahi karti. Aur jab dekho mere bete se bahar khana khane ke liye kehti rehti hai…
Lady 1: Aur damaad? 
Lady 2: Damaad to farishta hai. Roz subah meri beti ko chai bana ke pilata hai Usey ghar ka koi kaam karne nahi deta & aksar bahar khana khane le jata hai. Aisa damaad sabko mile!!

Lady1: How is your daughter-in-law?
Lady2: She is horrible. Wakes up late daily, my son makes tea for her. She doesn't do any household chores. And always keeps asking my son to take her out for dinner.

And these were anger and violence that were not there originally to begin with. And I did not want it for me anymore. This was not me and, I decided to just put an end to it. Easier said than done — I got it later on.

The second reason was that I came to realize I think that only by watching porn I take part in creating a demand for filmed prostitution because that’s what porn really is: filmed prostitution.

You hear the rain hit the windows.

Sleep drenches your eyes.

It's a holiday.

Back to sleep.

Venue : Rajeev Chowk station.

The incident happened yesterday when I was travelling from Gurgaon to Noida. So I had to change my route at Rajeev Chowk.

As I am new in the city I was not much aware of the platforms and the other fixtures. So I started looking for the route map which can help me reach Noida. In the midst of my search I hear a voice , ""Han beta pucho (yes son , ask )"".

I thought it wasn't intended for me so I ignored.

But again he said , "" kahan Jana hai tumhe"" ( where do you want to go "" )

I said Noida and he further guided me.

I thanked him with that confused smile, thinking that why was he doing this. He was standing next to the map and helping each and everyone who came there.

I was standing still and noticing him , he literally helped everyone who came near to the map.

I couldn't control my curiosity, went straight to him. And asked the reason behind this selfless work.

And here's what he said :

Initially he was shocked that why did I come back and that too for this. But he said :

I am a cancer patient and as per the doctors I would have died 3 years before. But by god's grace I am still alive. I have received this ""Bonus"" life. It has all come because of the blessings. So yes here I am  helping people as much I can. One day I have to die , but before that day comes I want to have as many blessings as I can.

I had nothing to say at that moment , but suddenly my eyes struck at a bag next to him which had chips , wafers and biscuits. Further I enquired about it that does he sells those stuff , to which he laughed and replied :

No no , these are for the sweepers. Once they start leaving for the day , I distribute it among them. They further take it to their kids. So yes , more of blessings.

At that moment I was shell shocked. Seeing such a pure soul in the midst of country's capital. Helping people selflessly. That too with a broad smile.

So yes. There are good people out there mate. Let us all be like them.

I clicked his pic too , here it is :

392,"Difference between frugal and cheap. 

Frugal is when you use less sugar in your tea because sugar is expensive.
Cheap is when you pocket five sachets of sugar from Cafe Coffee Day at your friend's birthday treat so that you can cut sugar costs.

Frugal is when you make things stretch an extra mile by nixing wastage - maybe you rinse out the mixie one more time to get all the pulp out or rehash last night's leftovers into tonight's cutlets.
Cheap is when you loudly remark to your friends who have dropped in to say hello about the rising cost of milk and sugar just before you ask them if they will have some coffee!

Frugal is when you shop on a high discount day from a place where prices are the lowest.
Cheap is when you haggle with a poor vendor and then break his back by demanding free coriander and green chilies over and above.

Frugal is wise.
Cheap is otherwise."

When asked by 7 why, 8 gave the same reply that 9 gave.
""You are inferior to me"".

Likewise,

7 slapped 6.

6 slapped 5.

5 slapped 4.

4 slapped 3.

3 slapped 2.

2 slapped 1.

1 welcomed 0 with love. Allowed 0 to stand next to it.

A bad friend is as harmful as 1000 enemies.
Even a mighty snake dies if a group of ants attack. Never be proud of your position. Stay grounded."

He performed very well in the exam and got AIR 2 in IIT-JEE 2001.

He opted for B Tech in computer science from IIT Kanpur.

Fast forward 4 years....

Being an excellent student, he received President's Gold Medal for the best academic performance in all disciplines of UG programme in the year 2005. He also jointly received Director's Gold Medal for outstanding all round achievement and leadership with Siddharth Choudhary.

Again fast forward 4 years....

His Brother Shubham Tulsiani prepared for IIT-JEE 2009 from Bansal Classes Kota.

He also got AIR 2 in IIT-JEE 2009.

He also opted for B Tech in computer science from IIT Kanpur

Fast forward 4 years....

He also bagged same set of medals - President's Gold Medal form the president of India, Pranab Mukharjee and the Director's Gold Medal in the year 2013.

Madhur had a perfect CPI of 10 while Shubham scored a CPI of 9.9 and that's the only difference between them. :P

I thought if I said yes, then he would disturb me for the whole exam. So to avoid him I tried to speak in Haryanvi language, so that he would think that I am not a studious fellow.

She said that if anyone who is not interested can leave the class. Everyone was quiet. Suddenly a back bencher got up and started walking towards the door.

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997.'

But you shouldn't do it, you shouldn't 'always' listen to us. You should do what you want because this is the age you can achieve your dreams.

She: Do you have any specific seat preference, sir?

Me(lightly): A seat beside a cute girl would be great.

She(smiling): Sure, you can take that chair and sit beside me.

Slightly taken aback by that unexpected response.

Me: Not now, but maybe some other time. You can give me your number and I would definitely call you next time I’m in the city.

She: That’s private.

.
.
.

Ans. I do daily up-down from ghaziabad to my college(Delhi). One night, I was in the bus going home from my college. Suddenly, a girl came & sat beside me. She was really close to me & her legs were shivering. I also noticed that she was looking behind again & again. I saw two men, looking like bouncers were there in the last seat. Well, when we reached AIIMS metro station, then I noticed that girl was following me. Then suddenly, I turned back & asked ""Is there any problem ma'am""? 

She- Two men were teasing, passing comments & now they are following me also. 

Me- Okay, do one thing, don't go in ladies coach. It will not work, they will chase you to your station. Just go in general coach then I will handle. You trusted me till, now do little bit more. 
[She went to general coach, those 2 men were came to the same coach & stood around her. I clicked their pics from my phone secretly. Then I came to her]

Me- Hi, shreya! ( I didn't even know her name, so I took any random name) You are on time for the party. Our all friends are waiting at Rajiv Chawk metro station. Pankaj, Karan, Sahil, Piyush, & so on (I took my college friend's name, especially of boys)

When they heard the their lot of friends are waiting at the Rajiv Chawk metro station & maximum are boys. They left the metro at the very next station. I gave those pics to that girl. So, that she can do police report. Since then, we both are great friends & surely I am proud of my act & it gave me alot of soul satisfaction that I helped a girl using my brain."
421,"Ques: What have you learnt at IIT?
.
.

Ans. All I did was study, study and study to get here but after coming to IIT, I realized that studies aren't everything in life (ironically).

The IIT mess maintained a remarkable consistency of making their food taste the same during my entire time at IIT and I realized that nothing beats food cooked by mom.

JEE is not an achievement. Its significance ends the day one steps inside IIT.

I realized the value of the little things in life. Stop for a moment and count your blessings....pure happiness can be derived out of it.

There is always someone better than you in some field or the other. People can be one of the best, not the best.
Humility beats ego, hands down.

IIT is just a platform to propel you to better things in life. If making it to IIT was your only dream, you are in a sorry state.

Women are stronger than men. In an institute with a sex ratio of around 11:1 or 10:1, they constantly outshine men in multiple walks of life.

Substance addiction sucks. There's nothing cool about smoking weed, cigarettes or drinking excessively.

Don't judge a person by his/her demeanour. In fact, just stop judging.

Chetan Bhagat is truly an idiot (pun intended). You just don't mess with an IIT prof and do things he jotted down in Five Point Someone.

The term 'non-IITian' is bullshit and shouldn't exist. There are scores of people who aren't studying in an IIT and are doing better things in life.

I've learnt the value of the word Peace."
422,"What is the most soul-satisfying thing you have ever done in your life?

This incident happened almost a year ago. I work for one of the public sector banks in Bangalore. One morning just as the business started, an immensely tensed guy came to me and told me that he had transferred an amount of Rs. 20K to a wrong person's account number last evening. The amount, he told, was meant for his relative's surgery which was required urgently. He said that he hailed from North East part of lndia and was working in Bangalore as a delivery boy for one of the food chains and had borrowed Rs.15K to send this money for an operation. He could not personally go and attend to his relative as his employer had put his salary on hold for the month because of a small road mishap on the company bike while making a delivery.

Though I could understand how critical the situation was for him, as a banker, in my right I could not reverse the erroneous credit to wrong account (technical and legal issues which require a person's confirmation before debit of his/her bank account). To make things worse the other person located in Madhya Pradesh, had already withdrawn the full amount of Rs. 20K from his account. I immediately called the other person and informed him how he had withdrawn an amount which was erroneously transferred to his account and requested him to return the amount. He replied that he was unaware of any such credit and was out of town and would check his account statement after two days when he gets back. 

The delivery boy, upon hearing this naturally lost hope of getting his money back and I could see the despair in his eyes. He was angry with himself for his carelessness while making the transfer and banged his fists gently on the wall. He just stood in front of me with sweat rolling down his face, trembling and helpless, far away from his home. With other customers impatiently waiting for me to attend to them and through all the clutter and noise in the banking hall, I could feel the agony he was going through at that moment.

After a few moments of consideration i made a decision and asked him the correct account number and immediately transferred Rs.20K from my personal account to his relative. Within the next 2 minutes he called his relatives and got a confirmation of the credit.(And i didn't know if the things the delivery guy had said were even true. But I decided to do it anyway, in good faith). Pleasantly surprised at the turn of events, he assured me that he would repay me back in installments out of his monthly salary. With tears rolling down his cheeks he thanked me and said he would never forget my act of kindness.

Two days later I called up the other person in Madhya Pradesh. Fortunately, without any fuss he accepted that he had checked his account and the money did not belong to him. Immediately he transferred the amount back to the delivery guy's account. I called the delivery guy and asked him to visit the bank. He withdrew Rs. 20K and handed it over to me. As I counted the amount, I handed over Rs. 5K back to him asking him to use the money to go back to his native place and attend to his sick relative. He hesitated saying that I had already done enough for him, but I insisted and he eventually accepted the money. With tears in his eyes again, he said he could not believe his good luck in such difficult moments. I patted his shoulder and told him to take home something from Bangalore for his siblings. He said he would remember me forever and left with a smile and disbelief on his face.

A week later he sent me images of his brother-in-law in hospital and a voice message saying that he was recovering well and thanked me for my very timely help.

So his story was true, and I was glad that I could extend timely help to him even if it was just in good faith. There was a great sense of fulfilment. Truly a soul satisfying experience. 

May the force be with us all!!

423,"What are some things men don't tell women?
.
.
.

1-That close guy friend of yours who has always been there for you like a brother? Yeah, he's thought about boning you. More than once. It's not entirely wrong though, he's still there for you. But if you gave him a chance, he'd probably take it with no remorse.

2-We're not dumb. But do prefer to simplify things in life.

3-We don't give a crap about most of the things you say. But we do want you to not have those problems anymore and stop being upset, so we will do our best to help you. And that's what it means for us to care for you in a relationship. We unfortunately see most of our discussions as a problem to be solved by us
.
4-Feminism has been hard to swallow because the fact of the matter is that a lot of us are still going to pay for dates, the house, the ring, and most of our expenses as a couple. We're super pro-equality. But like you, we also haven't seen it yet and sometimes it sucks, because quite a few women still subscribe to the patriarchal male strong man who will supply everything for them. Don't push feminism and ""the independent woman"" if we as a people haven't yet lived up to the one condition where it really affects men: money.

5-We're probably as insecure about our bodies as you are. Have you ever tried to count how many different muscle supplements there are out there?

6-If you think we're going to cheat with a younger/more attractive woman, the problem is not your looks. It's more likely your attitude (especially when we feel unappreciated; see point 4)

7-That being said, we do not want you to try and out-sexy all of the other women. When you have a partner, you and he are as intimate as can be, and we don't want you to share that intimacy with anyone else. So please don't dress like you're looking to impress someone; we know you're sexy; you don't have to show everyone else that too. Even if you genuinely do it to impress your partner and only him...don't. Just don't. (EDIT: obviously, nobody can or should tell you what to do, that's not at all what I mean to communicate. Try not to misinterpret my tone here, I'm only trying to express myself.) Other men still have eyes and it's simply annoying for us if every one of them can have a look at you even while you're holding our hand. It's borderline embarrassing.

8-Chivalry, sweetness, caring, and nurture must come from within us. Any woman who expects to be given a valentines gift, a fancy dinner, a door opened for them, etc. will be denied those luxuries, or at the very best, be given simple monetary compensation within her partner's abilities: you will be given empty dates, lifeless actions and meaningless gifts. But if you'd like to see real romantic gestures from deep in our hearts, be grateful for us and supply the feedback loop (more thankfulness = more gestures; we love seeing you smile and feeling appreciated just like you). However, if your mindset is ""what are you getting me"" or ""how many times are you going to say I love you today"" or ""when are we next going on a date? I expect you to show me you love me today"", then you are not only pestering us, you're also only receiving. And love is about giving.

9-Most important one here: WE ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR! We also get scared, insecure, excited, giddy, horny, wistful; we want to be happy around you, to be able to fight with you, to be able to be cute, to see you smile, to cry around you. It's just that all those emotions don't bode well for us in public, they make us uncomfortable. We would much rather choose one woman with whom we can be that way around. And if it's not our mother, you'll be lucky if it's you :)"

I got back to sleep and then even when I was not fully sleep, I felt a blanket over me. Oh! this must be Dad. He switched on the mosquito repellent, switched off the lights and then during midnight, I noticed that he came to accompany me in my room.
Now, when the Mom's love is loud and clear. I fail to notice that Dad is loving and probably he loves me more than he loves my siblings.

That blanket reminded me of thousands of similar incidents since childhood. His love and care is mute and hence often go unnoticed.

I also didn't realize that he has taken leave as I came home after long time.

He did that as he wanted to spend some more time with me.
Love of a Dad is often underrated. I regret taking his love for granted.

""Your thoughts are limited by your vocabulary."", my father told me when I was a teenager.

That one line set me on the path to reading, building my vocabulary, falling in love with dictionaries, enjoying word-play, and attempting to write well and speak well. This expanded the horizons of my comprehension, and also gave me the ability to appreciate the refined, subtle thoughts written by others. There is a richness to the commentary of human experience that I would have missed out on had I not enjoyed reading and writing as much as I do.

Just then  my mother snatched the packet from me and told me that this is not something to eat . I started arguing and asked why she's acting so foolish. Chocolate's are meant for kids.

Then my mother came up with excuse that these packets are going to be added in the cement to make masi's house more strong and hence not made for eating( my masi's house was being constructed).My inquisitiveness still didn't get satisfied and asked further why is that a chocolate flavour then. She told me that it will give chocolate color to the walls. Matter solved but my insatiable inquisitiveness still not get satisfied.

433,"What should be most effective way to eliminate reservation completely by the ruling party in India, minimizing opposition and violence?
.
.
.
.

Balaji Viswanatha's Answer

The best way to remove reservation is to bring rapid economic upliftment to all. Our pace of economic reforms is too slow. Bring it up two notches.

Thoughtful urbanization - Indus Valley style: The biggest reason that caste system continued in India compared to other societies [Europe, Japan] is the deurbanization in the colonial era [Bihar and UP were especially deurbanized - and became caste hubs] . As Ambedkar rightly noted, urbanization is a great antidote to existing hierarchies and the caste system. India is the least urbanized major economy and most of the caste violence happen in our villages. Once urbanization is made in a planned way and caste violence reduces, reservation as a major plank will be weakened. Let's take inspiration from the indus valley civilization - highly urbanized and showing very little signs of major discrimination.

Rapid, mass-scale skill development: We have nearly 400 million youth and we have nowhere near that many college/school seats. And we might never get there either. That means we need to bring massive tech changes in the way we teach. That would do two things - 
1) bring the poorest of poor out of their vicious cycle and 
2) make the college selection not as crucial - if everyone can get good skill development, what is the big deal with a college admission?

To be kind. I could have been gentle as a river to that man's wound. Less manipulation. Less pain to the patient. 

To be right. Wash it thouroughly. Drain all the pus. Drop hydrogen peroxide. Wash again.This would cause him immense pain.

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich.
A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.
The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke'

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.
This becomes routine until the two enter again.
'The usual?' asks the waitress. 
'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. 
'Same,' says the ostrich. 
Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' 
Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.
The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. 
""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?""

He'd slapped me thrice!
In one go!

I was astonished, I loved him. That moment I felt very powerless in front of him. I couldn't handle my heart and the pain it was in when this happened. My tears wouldn't stop and i felt like I would faint due to the intensity of hurt I'd felt. I was never this weak!

I couldn't breathe for a while, I went into flashback, thinking, is he the same guy, I cooked for? I did not know anything, I still did my best. I took care while he was being treated at a hospital. I supported him emotionally when everybody around him refused to mix up with him.
He... slapped me...! me! 
Doesn't he know, I love him!
I was almost collapsed, my father too never raised his hands at me. My faith suddenly disappeared, I couldn't utter another word. I'd wept like a loser, I remember! I had lost love, faith and trust.

I did not know what to do next. I was so weak that I did not have the courage to face the day. I took off from things. I would start crying anywhere I was thinking and recalling all that. I was badly broken. I had nothing but extreme pain.
The idea of love started to scare me.I used to analyze if I'd done anything wrong enough to get beaten up. I found nothing. Months later, I went out to find a gym, I don't know why I decided this.
I found one. I fucking trained myself. 2 hours..3 hours and what not! I soon realized that all I want for myself is just power.I lifted, I felt strong, I killed my pain, I ignored the ruptures inside, I trained with 20 other guys and matched their stamina. I'd sweat instead of tears on my cheeks.

After I got back from the gym at night, I used to weep a lot! This went on for a couple of months. In fact, there were times when I would go to the changing room to cry, hiding from everyone. I needed to cry!
I did not share all these with my family or even closest of friends because I understood that only I can help myself. I was already damaged inside, it did not matter to me if it damaged me physically. I told my trainer to train me as rough as possible and not to worry about anything and assured him that I'll never complain. I'd never pushed myself this far, I was totally out of my comfort zone. My body ached like anything but I liked it.
Nobody dared to ask me to join aerobics group in the gym, soon everybody knew what my appetite was! Aerobics appeared lame to me(no offence), due to the amount of aggression I had, I needed heavy metal! I couldn't figure out a better solution to relieve my anger. I never stopped improving myself. I became the only girl in my gym at whom my trainer would feel proud.
He did not train me with the other girls in the gym. He didn't even consider me as one of the sophisticated girls after I made my declaration. I used to have marks on my palms and knees due to heavy workouts. I stopped wearing gloves to have hard hands.
I killed almost any scope of being soft inside. I abolished every weak emotion of mine during the workout. Gym became my second home.He brought tyres weighing more than 50 kg(I am 48 kg) later on, and made me pick it up and run, squat from it and do other heavy workout forms.
I slowly increased my weights during weight training too. He told me, start counting when it starts to hurt as told by Muhammad Ali.
I bought a punching bag too. I named it ****, inside my mind and I'd hit it hard, hard and harder. 

The weakness inside me erupted to make me strong! I became mentally tough more than I was physically because:
Pain is temporary but pride is forever.
You gain the strength of the temptation you resist.
I am one strong person now and trust me I've all the courage, stamina, strength and confidence to hit that pig back. I was all capable to hit him even that day, but my emotions were so weak to gain that much of strength, I used to see a father like figure in that monster because, he at times did care for me.
NO FUCKS GIVEN:  I am happy as hell.

LESSONS LEARNT:
Analyze the person correctly with whom you're in love.
Don't stick even for a single second to that person if you're not being valued or are being taken for granted.
Don't think that leaving that person will end your life, NO! it'll only create a place for someone more deserving, trust me.
Your love has to be your strength and not your weakness!
MOST IMPORTANTLY:
If you feel you're with the best person, take charge of your life, show courage, get married!
Stop breaking up from your love for castes and religions. These are the most bullshit reasons to invite pain and problems. Actually, nobody gives a shit if you married a muslim being hindu and what not!
Be brave and have faith.

EDIT 1: A lot of people are asking me if I have ever hit the guy back. My answer is NO. I come from a family where we've values like kindness, humanity, respect and other decent qualities. Had I'd hit him, it would have eliminated differences between me and him and I would never have known my strengths.
I recently saw him accidentally, we both were at an IIT campus, I couldn't create a scene there, although one part of mine was eager to rip his muscles from his body but I controlled myself. I immediately went a few meters away from him to avoid any potential fight.
Sure my blood does boil, I belong to the family of freedom fighters, but I am not an animal like him. I am more respectful than him, in all the ways and he'd better understood it that day. He wanted to talk, I denied saying he didn't deserve my time and it happened in front of a few of his friends. Moreover, I am now totally clear about what I want in my life and I've understood my worth. I won't settle for anything lesser than what I deserve."

It's me. I am the biggest hypocrite.

I, who whenever possible shout for women's right. Write on Quora how women in India have been oppressed for generations. But when it comes to marriage I want a girl who would stay at home and take care of my kids.

I, a secular, forward-thinking atheist, who knows that science is the way forward, who hates the marginalization of Muslims in India. But when reads a news that Muslim population has increased 27% in the last decade in India, goes on a cursing spree.

I, who thinks that corruption is killing our growth,  who thinks, nepotism is killing the opportunities for youth, and publicly advocates the end of both. But when it suits me, I am the one who initiates the process of bribing for a seat in AC, for without test D/L, without exam degrees, I when find a job opportunity, get my brother posted.

I, who writes long statuses on Facebook, Blogger, and WordPress after an incident of rape in Delhi. Just when the roommate sleeps, opens an incognito window and search for *** rape porn and masturbate.

I, who repetitively blame the Pakistani Government to sponsor terrorism, completely ignore that Naxals kill more people than terrorists in my country. Somehow it doesn't evoke the same response. Partially because it's my nation who is at fault somehow.

447,"This happened to me in an interview with one of the best companies to work for. Let me keep the company name anonymous. The conversation is about smart-work vs hard-work and I am asked this question since I believe in smart-work.

Question: what is the best trick you have ever used to get something? 

Answer: During my engineering I had a tough time studying and clearing this subject called Signals&Systems and here is how I cleared it.

To pass you need a combined score of 50 between internal tests and the final exam. My score is 14 out of 25 in the internals and hence I needed to score 36 out of 100 in my final exam to make the total 50(14+36).

So I was sitting in the final exam hall and irritated at how tough the exam was. I have hardly been able to solve half the questions and I'm sure that I could end up failing by a short margin.

At this point I decided to write a note to the invigilator examiner. This works sometimes if you are lucky and moreover my friends had tried this earlier successfully. All you need to do is write your internal tests' marks at the end of the paper so that the invigilator examiner gives you the marks required to make it 50. So here is what I HAD to write:

Internals: 14
Finals: 36 (plzz)
Total: 50 :-)

But me being an ass, got another WEIRD thought while I was writing the above. I thought ""What if the invigilator examiner is another ass like me and decides to give me 35, just to piss me off for failing by 1 mark and also as a lesson to not write a note to the examiner again?"".

So here is what I write:

Internals: 13
Finals: 37 (plzz)
Total: 50 :-)

Result: The invigilator examiner gave me 36 to piss me off for failing by 1 mark.

I have the last laugh.

I cleared Signals&Systems.. ;)
I cleared the interview round.. :) 
But had to reject the offer for other reasons.

448,"Short Stories: What is a short story which can enlighten me on life problems?

.
.
.

A boy was born to a couple after eleven years of marriage. They were a loving couple and the boy was the gem of their eyes. When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for office so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife, preoccupied in the kitchen totally forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle and playfully went to the bottle fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous medicine meant for adults in small dosages. When the child collapsed the mother hurried him to the hospital, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified how to face her husband. When the distraught father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and uttered just five words.

QUESTIONS :
1. What were the five words ?
2. What is the implication of this story?

ANSWER :
The husband just said ""I am with you Darling""

          The husband's totally unexpected reaction is a proactive behavior. The child is dead.. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened.. No one is to be blamed. She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was consolation and sympathy from the husband. That is what he gave her.

          If everyone can look at life with this kind of perspective, there would be much fewer problems in the world. ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"". Take off all your envies, jealousies,unforgiveness, selfishness, and fears. And you will find things are actually not as difficult as you think.

MORAL OF THE STORY:

Having spent three years with him ,I know him as a person beaming with Josh always and every single time and ready to put all things down for a single match or even a single time route of the cross country in NDA.

You were not merely a course mate ,you were a dear friend, a guiding light, a shoulder to cry on during the toughest times one endured during the rigorous training in NDA.

You know this guy right? The much acclaimed Yogi from the TVF Pitchers? He was unhappy that Indian Television industry didn’t have content rich shows. So, he approached the most popular youth-oriented channel – MTV India. He expressed that he is keen to start something which is content rich. MTV rejected his idea.

After this, he started his own modest venture. Fast forward to the year 2015, and he has 1,096,581 subscribers to his YouTube channel. He is now known as The Qtiyapa Guy.
In his own words, ”When MTV rejected the idea, I think that was the best rejection of my life. Youth channels told me Indian youth doesn’t want to watch this. I wanted to prove them wrong. Had they accepted, the idea would have ended up in some maximum 10 to 15 episodes.”

She told me its going to be easy for her to ask her parents for me. This filled me with confidence and I started to loosen the information on my family. Slowly and gradually, my whole family got the news that I am in love with a girl. Everybody found her sweet and liked her.

One day I got a call from her that there is a boy coming to see her. I asked her to decline the proposal as usual. But the story took a twist there. After the meeting she called me and started crying that I am not able to convince my parents and they want me to marry this guy. I told her to let me talk to them. She denied that its of no use don't do it. Next day she called me and told me that her father has said yes to the other family. I was like, ""he can't go against your will you just say No to the other family"".

Short Answer - Yes they do!
Going by your definitions, my wife is definitely 'brighter' than me in all aspects.

I met my wife in college. We were best friends for 2 years, dated for the next 6 years and have been happily married for the last 2 years. 

School My wife topped in school for 12 straight years! I tried to hang on to above average.
College This was where we met. At the end of four years, she was in the top 5 in a class of 120. I was in the bottom 5 in a class of 30.
MBA We ended up in the same college, same batch. Again she was among the top 10 while I was again somewhere near the average mark.
Job She got the highest paying job in the entire batch. As for me(yeah you guessed it right!) again the average.

Like I said, this situation conforms to exactly what you have mentioned in your question.

Does she have respect for me? Yes she does.

So what makes us click? 

I think for any relationship to work, there has to be a balance. Both the partners have to complement each other and I think we do a pretty decent job at that.

In college, she was studying hard. What about me? i learnt how to play a couple of musical instruments,acted in college plays and skits, read a lot of books, made friends etc.

I was chasing my passions, she was chasing her goals. Deep inside we both respected each other for what the other was doing. She had the fire in her belly, while I was the calm one. She used to freak out when she got less marks and trusted me to calm her down. At the same time I could trust her to yell at me to ensure that I studied enough to at least clear my exams.

Even today, it is the same thing - every weekend she is ready with a list of household chores and I am ready with a list of best movies playing on TV. We generally end up going through half of each list.

To sum it up, I don't think a relationship will work if you judge a person for his/her looks, degrees, paychecks or any other thing that is quantifiable. We all will have ups and downs in our careers, we all will age. What matters is that your partner should complete you.

I hope I was able to help!

My parents have an amazing sense of humour with a pinch of sarcasm, which reflects in everything they say and do, and this was by far the most embarrassing things said by them in front of my crush.

There was a guy in my school on whom I had developed a crush, which grew stronger with time. We lost contact after 6th standard and only recently we came in touch with each other. 
One day, we planned for a movie. It was a winter afternoon, and I had asked him to come home and get permission from my parents to take me with him. As my parents knew him as my good friend, and he also told them that three other friends were coming with us, they agreed on sending me for movie. 
Now, as you can guess, I was very excited for that day. It was the first time we were going out together. I wore my best dress, put a little make-up with extra dark kohl ( I knew he had a thing for girls wearing kohl), kept my long hair open, and decided not to wear anything warm but a thin multi-coloured jacket that matched my purple full sleeved top. 
I looked at myself in the mirror, flaunting myself, and left the room.

He was waiting for me outside. As I was about to climb his bike, my maa called from behind, ""Arey ye patli jacket kyun pehen kar ja rahi ho?? Thand ho rahi hai, tumhara potty ka pressure ban jata hai thand se, bhool gayi? Jao jakar kuch garam pehno!""

My friends virtually never dined in a restaurant or hotel when they were there as the lunch/dinner invites never ever stopped. Mind-boggling stuff.

Trucks' decoration -- I've seen some incredible images of trucks in Pakistan and how decked up they are. No one pimps a truck like a Pakistani does!

Ans. I will tell you my story.
I never excelled in school.
I always scored average marks.
My parents sent me to the best schools.
I did not get admissions into any great engineering college which my parents wanted.(My dad was a topper of GATE in his batch).
After college I was not getting a nice job.
So I did SAP ABAP certification and luckily cleared it.
The cost of the exam was nearly 3.5 lakhs.
But still I did not get a job.(I did not have 60% in BE)
So I started working at 5000 Rs as a trainee consultant in a local firm which had SAP. I worked very hard but was not getting a raise. Worked for 1.2 years there at 5000 per month. But i had worked very very hard during this period. So I got a job at Volkswagen India as an SAP ABAP consultant.
But after three months I got an offer letter from Japan. Even though Volkswagen was a big name I quit as they did not have many projects.
15 days before I was to leave for Japan(I had already resigned from Volkswagen India) I was told that the project is off and the job is gone.
Volkswagen did not take me back and I was jobless.
I gave many interviews but was not getting selected.
My life had hit very very low.
One day I called up my mom and broke down.
I said to her that I was sorry as I was never able to make her happy.
She told me to calm down
She said
I got happy when you walked for the first time.
I got happy when you spoke for the first time.
Your first day of school.
And numerous other things.
All our parents want is us to be happy. They do not measure love on the success of the child. Keep working hard for your goals.
You want to make your mom happy ?
Call her everyday. She waits for the whole day that you would call but you do not.
Ask how her day was. Whats the latest gossip in the family etc. Talk to her on various topics that she likes.
Obviously Indian parents want their kids to excel. That is because the previous generation have worked very hard for our upbringing.
Imagine when your parents were in their twenties.
Did they have many facilities/luxuries/freedom/money that we do today ?
My mom was lucky enough to go to a local college. Her college was five mins from home(she was told to attend the nearest one). After college if she was not home within five minutes someone would leave for her college to pick her up.
The point I am trying to make is that our parents have seen a lot of struggle, and thus if they see you getting all the facilities that they never even hoped of they would obviously tell you to work hard.
Hope this helps."

My father is addicted to tobacco. Being an Indian son it is very difficult for me to force them or talk to them directly about this matter. Then too, I requested them many times to quit the habit. My mother and all my relatives advise them regularly but he didn't bother. 

One fine morning many of my relatives were at our place for a family function. I had my tea and went to the sitting room. Almost 15 to 20 people were present at our place. I took out a cigarette from my pocket and lit it. All the relatives were shocked. A 25 year old boy, how can he dare to smoke and that too in front of all relatives. My father stood up came to me and slapped me. I just kept looking at him and took another puff. One of my brothers snatched the cigarette from my hand and threw it. 

Everybody gathered around me and started asking me why I did so? I asked my father why he slap me. He said, ""how can you smoke in front of your father?"".

I said, ""when you can eat tobacco in front of your father, why cant I"". He just stared me for a minute and went in his room, brought the tobacco pouch and handed it over to me and said ""today I quit"". 

For me; the most terrifying moment was to take out cigarette from the pocket and light it in front of all.

When you are admitted to a hospital, they place on your wrist a white wristband with your name on it. But there are other different colored wristbands which symbolize other things. The red wristbands are placed on dead people.

There was one surgeon who worked on night shift in a school hospital. He had just finished an operation and was on his way down to the basement. He entered the elevator and there was just one other person there. He casually chatted with the woman while the elevator descended. When the elevator door opened, another woman was about to enter when the doctor slammed the close button and punched the button to the highest floor. Surprised, the woman reprimanded the doctor for being rude and asked why he did not let the other woman in.

The doctor said, “That was the woman I just operated on. She died while I was doing the operation. Didn’t you see the red wristband she was wearing?”

The woman smiled, raised her arm, and said, “Something like this?”

#never_back_down

Some background: In May 2009, I was in my last semester of engineering with only two months left for my final university exams, and oh! yes, to join Barclays bank to start my career with as an Assistant software engineer. I got placed during my 6th semester in 2008.

I was excited as a rookie as it was a big deal, honestly at that time, I was very talkative, fun loving, had a bunch of friends around me - always, but something happened which made me actually aware about the reality of life, love, friends, parents, relations and others important aspects of life.

The day when it happened- 24th May 2009, 8.30-9.00 pm approx.

1. I had met with an accident which left-me with Spinal-cord injury to T5,T6,T8 level along with I had fractured my jaw and eye bone.

2. Eye bone, cheek bone fractured. ( It caused me Metallic screw and bolts fixation in facial surgery )

3. I went through surgeries, I still remember I used wake up in the middle of my plastic surgery, almost unconscious, telling them to give me more anesthesia. (It makes me laugh today again)

4. Moreover, I still remember my mom used to help me to pass my stool, and urine. She helped me from brushing to attending nature's calls.

5. I was not able to move my body, I was on 180 degrees on hard plywood bed, nothing in my body was functional except my brain. 

6. I was not able to talk, had plastic surgery to repair cheek bone, and internally my jaw had stitches, my lips were hollow as doctors had cut my lips inside to take skin from it and to use that skin on my cheek as used in surgery. 

7. I was not able to move, even I was not able to scratch my back, tilt myself, just imagine yourself on bed 180 degrees, flat, throughout 10 months, have gone through many seasons as winter summer ( 45-50 degrees) which gave me bed sores due to heat I burnt my skin on the back as there was no scope for air to get passed.

After 25 days of my accident, I was on bed like a vegetable, a thought came suddenly to my mind -- What about my placement? Would I be able to join?

I thought a lot and made my mind that I would give the final exams which was after 20 days from then (the day I had made my mind)  If I hadn't given my 8th semester exams, I would have failed, obviously. Failing in exams meant that Barclays would withdraw their offer.
 
I was stubborn and childish. I told my father that I wanted to appear for exams.  Initially he was shocked and laughed and said ""Koi na next year de dena guddu"" ( Never mind guddu we will do it next year).

After many  arguments  he agreed but put up many questions, such as.

You can not move your body, how will you go to your exam center?
How will you write?
You cannot even hold a book straight, how will you study?
You can not sit and all other obvious questions you could imagine.

Later ,I agreed to drop the plan but very next day my father said: ""We will go and give the exams, if you want to do it we will go and as a father I do not want to face a situation where after 10 years or so you grow up and say, I am here because of you Papa, I wish you would have allowed me to appear in the exams.""

Everybody, including the doctors thought that I was a fool. But, my father was with me. Before we went to give exams ( in Jaipur which is 500 kms far away from my hometown ) I talked to my so called 'friends' for their help as I was about to go there with my parents and needed there support to study and to take care of my parents. My parents are very simple they are not that modern, but are really gem at there hearts.

Every one said: Yes, we will be there to support you, just come here. We will help you with studies by group studying. Fikar not,tu aa ja baaki hum dekh lenge. (Don't worry, come here and we will take care of everything else).

And because of these promises I became self assured.

We left for Jaipur, 5 days before my exams, hoping my friends will take care of everything . They helped me for 2 days, and later on started rebuffing with lies -- such as, they were sick, or they had many other important things to do, or I was looking very ugly, my eyebrow was shaved during surgery on my face, I was not able to open my eye cause of stitches but I got to know that they were busy partying as last semester, last moments, last month of the engineering -- party everywhere as everyone about to apart from each other after this.

So I started to study on my own. My father used to hold the book up in the air and keep moving pages as per been told and I kept reading. He used to do this for at least 12 hours a day, I was ashamed and used to cry at night. Alone. Silently, so that they could not hear me crying.

I was in a state of transition, where I let my family down, my parents, they were suffering, I was emotionally broke and it was hurting me that my parents are suffering because of me.

I  was cornered all around.

Suddenly all the bullshit went off and I felt nothing about this world outside me, people around me, now it was like I was just breathing in and out seeing the fan above me, I just worked pretty hard afterwards.

I used to go to my exam center by an ambulance on a spinal stretcher tide with belts over my chest so that I wont move a bit . And, at center 10 people used to take me out from ambulance and get me to a special room and put me there on a bed.

I was assigned a writer to convert my speech/answers into letters in my answer sheet. His name is Dheeraj, he was my junior, I really appreciate his dedication towards it.

Anyhow, after the exams, my so called friends used to come to the hall room to meet me, and my eyes kept searching a special person all the time after my exam, but she never appeared.

I gave my 6 exams like that -- in 17 days, and went back to my home town. 500 Km away from Jaipur, on a spinal stretcher. It was painful, in fact more painful for my parents to see and feel all of this. During that 500 km journey there were 20+ temples on the way. They stopped at every temple and prayed my speedy recovery though I was sleeping all the time. (My driver later on told me about it.)

After 3 months my results were declared. I got my highest marks since I started studying, which were 81 % in 8th semester. My father was extremely proud and the tears in his eyes assured me that. 

My friends, the person I loved, they left me. But, my parents, my sister, my brother in law, my brother, they were around me. It took nearly 8 months for me to walk again. To sit. To gain sensation. To move, basically.

Although I wasn't able to join Barclays since it took almost a year for me to walk again, I worked hard and now, I'm working as a senior analyst -- 3000 kms away from my home. Alone. 

I love my family :)"

Dhawal Barot's Answer

It was 1:43 a.m. and Meera received an SMS, ""I love you Meera. Do you? - Raj"".

Next morning when Meera checked her mobile, she blushed with reading Raj's text. After all, she had feelings for Raj, and they were best friends for more than 4 years. They both were introverts, so were always afraid to initiate, but finally Raj took the lead.

Instead of calling Raj, she texted him back, ""Let's meet at friends cafe @8 p.m ""

After a big hang out and party night, Raj woke up in the afternoon and noticed the SMS series. He felt like an idiot because he wasn't aware about the SMS due to liquor effect. He discussed the scenario with his roommates cum friends Nayan & Aakar.

They both motivated him by saying, ""Yes Raj, you did that SMS last night after confessing your love for her. You both love each other since the last 4 years. Now please be a pair."".

Raj thought that maybe his friends were right and Meera didn't acknowledge negatively so it is worth a shot now.

They both met at friends cafe, but nervousness was all around. Raj and Meera were even afraid to make eye contact with each other. Meera was just about to say something, but Raj quickly interrupted, ""Sorry. I was drunk and text you that,"" and expressed,""Shitt!!"".

With a very soft and rueful voice Meera asked, ""So, don't you love me?""

Raj quickly acknowledged, ""I didn't say that, I mean I love you and..."", there he realized that he expressed his feeling in nervousness.

Meera smiled and asked, ""Seriously?""

Finally, Raj got confident to utter a word from Meera's positive expressions, and he replied, ""Yes,"" and asked, ""Do you?"".

Meera replied, ""I was waiting for this moment since the last 4 years Raj. Of course, I do"".

Finally, they got a promotion in their relationship and became lovers. Raj was so happy that he shared everything with Nayan and Aakar by saying, ""I won the bet guys, you both were saying that I can't make it to propose Meera. Today I did that. So now, bet amount please."".

Nayan and Aakar paid the bet amount to him by congratulating him.

Raj advised them in a hyperbole mood to tease them, ""Guys, you both should find a girl now. We can do the couple hang out, you see. If you want, I can ask Meera, if she has any girls in mind. Anyway, have to go now on a date with Meera at lovers cafe. So, bye-bye single pals.""

Raj left like a lottery winner and they both just smiled at him. Whenever Raj does this kind of comment, Nayan and Aakar smile internally. 

Because the truth was when Raj got down after a few pegs by expressing his feelings for Meera to them. It was Nayan and Aakar only who had texted Meera from Raj's mobile. 

They knew very well that neither Meera nor Raj would initiate and that their beautiful relationship just needs a first gear. They surely lost the bet, but won more than that.

I was representing the USA in an international table tennis (ping pong) tournament in Osaka, Japan. The night before I wandered over to the tournament site to check it out.  When there I noticed a guy wearing a Chinese team jacket. They were and still are the best in the world.  Being somewhat cocky, I went over and asked him if he would like to hit some.  He did and we eventually played a best-of-three match. I was playing well and managed to eke out a win.

Back with my teammates I modestly mentioned that I had beaten a Chinese player.  To my astonishment some skepticism was expressed.  Being fed up, the next day I suggested to the most skeptical teammate that we stroll over to where the Chinese team was camped out.  I didn't see the player from last night, so I started talking to one of the other Chinese players. Finally I casually mentioned that I had won a match with one of his teammates.

Right at the moment the bus is about the start, a girl of my age came in and stared at me & spoke something to driver which I didn't mind to listen.

She was expecting me to give her the seat. Because if a lady sits next to me then it becomes a ladies seat. The driver & conductor was also expecting me to move back.

There is only one seat at the last row of the bus.

I explained my situation to the girl but she doesn't seem to listen, so as a courtesy I got up to check the last seat & found out it was broken & uncomfortable, that's why it's not taken.

Before I came back, she sat on my seat comfortably. I haven't got enough strength to argue & fight at that time, so I simply moved back and made the journey in discomfort.

She didn't even mind to say a thank you. She can't sit at the last row, she doesn't have time to wait for the next bus.

In 2010, the girl I loved more than anything, the love of my life, left me abruptly and (arranged) married another man just because he was much richer than me. I had lost hope 

And then, my mom passed away. I had no dad. There was no money in the house and I had to vacate. I stayed at friends' place, looking for ways to kill myself without causing trouble for others. I would get up every single day hoping to die that day. I had failed on every walk of life. And then it happened. 

I met with an accident. No, I didn't jump in front of the milk truck that hit me. It was an accident. The last thing I remember was the crimson of my blood dripping from god knows where into my eyes. I hoped it was going to be fatal. I couldn't feel my left arm, there 

I knew I had hit rock bottom. This was the lowest point in my life. Laying there in the middle of the road, soaking in my own blood, something hit me on a very fundamental level.

I had absolutely nothing, which means I had nothing more to lose.

If you leave Tokyo by plane at 7 am, you will arrive in Honolulu at approximately 7:45 pm the previous day
Due to a massive gap in time zones, Honolulu is 19 hours behind Tokyo. Subtracting the 7 hour and 45 minute flight time between these two cities gives us a trip difference of 11 hours and 15 min. Therefore, you would actually land in Hawaii more than 11 hours before you left Japan!

The other day I was at a small hotel that I frequent here in Bangalore. There is a 10 year old boy who works there taking orders and serving the food. He's a very nice boy who is always smiling. 

So that fine day, I was there having my lunch alone, and two people (a guy and a girl) came by and sat at the table beside me. And within a few minutes the boy was at their table.
However before placing their order, the girl asked him what his name was and what his age was. The boy replied his name and age.

And almost instantly the girl asked him if the people running the hotel are forcing him to work here. The boy replied no. She told him there is no need to be afraid and asked him again. But the answer was the same.  She continued to ask more details about his family, his native place, who takes care of him here in Bangalore, how he sends the money he gets to his home. The boy gave answers to all the questions becoming a little emotional in the process but was very strong enough not to cry. And then the girl told him, ""whenever you feel troubled here, or whenever you feel this job is bored and you no longer want to work here or whenever you want to go home to your parents, just let me know. I'll book a ticket for you and put you on the train to your hometown."" The boy was blushing by now. I could literally sense the happiness in him.

Why I would call this the bravest thing I've seen is that, in our day to day live we see so many problems happening  around us. And most of the times, we end up closing our eyes to them and thinking why the hell should I care. But we do know to share some useless pics on Facebook and forward stupid messages on Whatsapp and think we have done our bit for the society. Sometimes it just takes that one word from us to change a lot of things happening around. And on that note, what the girl did there was remarkable and stupendous. She simply earned my respect without doing any favors for me and that to me is the bravest thing ever!"

We were in our 7th semester, placed in decent companies by then and pretty much lost interest in anything that was then related to academics. We had stopped attending most of the classes, we had only 2 courses and a project. One of these courses was taken by our HOD and 2 of my friends and I had bunked as usual. For some reason, another friend of ours had gone and he decided to give us proxies. It was an unspoken pact among the 5-6 of us that whoever attended class would try his best to give the other guys a proxy and hence try and reach the minimum attendance required to write the semester ending exams.

This dude was a little stoned or I don't know what happened, but on this day along with another guy he went overboard and in a class where one could easily assess a head count of about 25-30, between all these guys 54 guys had got attendance. Our HOD freaked out and apparently gave the expression - Mujhe chu*iya samajh ke rakha hai kya? and then he went to every single person and got the list of 26 people who had got a proxy.

Back our friend comes crawling in his dirty jeans and reveals this fantastic news to the 3 of us, saying the HOD wants to meet all of us and he tells us 'Do whatever the fuck you guys want to'. Now my friend and I were slowly thinking of going the Gandhian way and telling the truth and asking for forgiveness and hopefully trying to convince the HOD to bail all of us out of any trouble, while the other friend said, Screw you guys, I am not going to reveal who gave us proxy, I am not a SNITCH. I will handle it. We kept asking him how he planned to handle it, but he said we won't need to speak a word and that he would take care of it.

So we all went to the HOD's cabin, 3 of us and here's how it went.

HOD: Who gave you proxy?
Friend: That's exactly my question Sir, who the hell gave us proxy?

H: What? I don't know. Must be one of your friend, tell me who?
F: Sir, I don't know who gave us proxy and I think this is not acceptable. You need to make sure such things don't happen. Back when I was in 9th my friend got a proxy in class and he met with an accident and then when he filed for insurance, the insurance guys came to know from school that he attended that class, so he could not get the insurance. Then he had to go through a lot of trouble and even our school had got into a lot of problems, you can google it if you want. (Some random story)

H: But..
F: No Sir, this can have dire consequences. What if something happens to me tomorrow and some idiot gives me a proxy in class?

H: Well..
F: In a prestigious college like ours, we need to have a strict mechanism to take care of these things. One such thing can spoil our name.

H: Ok.. I am Sorry.
F: It's OK Sir. If you come to know who gave us proxy, please tell that person not to do such things in the future and you also take care to avoid this situation

H: OK. Sorry about this.
F: Thank you Sir. See you in the next class.

And all this while, the two of us were trying our best to control our laughter. We finally came out of the room, ran as far as possible and laughed our asses off. Had never seen someone deal with a situation like this and turn it on it's head in such emphatic fashion.

Girl 3: No, I am not coming and I have to complete this task. You girls carry on and if the cafeteria is open, get something for me too.

Girl 1 & Girl 2 said ok for that and they left the classroom.

We, the guys, listened to this conversation while we are doing our work. 

After sometime, the two girls returned furiously into the classroom with rage. We guys noted this and stopped our work and started looking at them.

Girl 3: Hey, What happened? Why you two are upset and angry?

Girl 1: You know. We went to the cafeteria. The cafeteria was open but the bill counter was closed. We found the cafeteria supervisor near the counter. He was closing the accounts. We went to him and asked whether any snacks or food items available.

Girl 3: Ok. Then?

Girl 1: For that, he told that the accounts are closed. It will not be possible for him to produce a bill. Then, he told that there are still snacks available in the kitchen and he asked us if we need, we can take it for free. (Girl 1 started shouting angrily) How dare he say like that? As if, we don’t have money to get those snacks. Are we the ones who are eating the free foods? What that idiot is thinking of us? I just told him on his face that we don’t need that and we left.

Girl 3: Ok. Calm down. Leave him. Don’t waste your time by thinking about a person who doesn't know the manners.

Then, it happened--I got pregnant. I think I peed on at least 20 sticks--all plus signs. Just as I was sitting down at dinner to tell my boyfriend and to ask him what we wanted to do about it, he says ""I have something I've been meaning to tell you--I think we should break up."" I just started shaking and sobbing and it was quite a show. Eventually I mustered up the ability to say what I needed to say. He got up and walked out and never came back. I called my dad sobbing beyond anything he'd ever dealt with before from his daughter.

""Why can't I find a man like you, dad? Someone who does the right thing and acts like a man and respects me as someone's daughter?""

...That's when the silence hit. 

""Daddy?"" I asked. 

Still silent. 

After a while, he said,""You know, I wasn't always the man you know. There was a time before you were born that I dated someone who I wasn't very fair to. I broke her heart...""

I said, ""Yeah, but you apologized. You always take accountability.""

Much to my surprise, he said, ""No. No, I never did apologize."" 

There was a long pause. 

""But I can tell you one thing: 

""If I wasn't sorry about it then, I certainly am double sorry now. Sorry doesn't even explain it. Because despite what I might have done to someone's daughter back then... there's no greater pain than watching a young man do to your own daughter what you did to someone else's 40 years earlier.""

When I’m Gone

Death is always a surprise. No one expects it. Not even terminal patients think they are going to die in a day or two. In a week, maybe. But only when this particular week is the next week.

We are never ready. It is never the right time. By the time it comes, you will not have done all the things that we wanted to. The end always comes as a surprise, and it’s a tearful moment for widows and a bore for the children who don’t really understand what a funeral is (thank God).

It was no different with my father. In fact, his death was even more unexpected. He was gone at age 27. The same age that claimed the lives of several famous musicians. He was young. Way too young. My father was not a musician and neither a famous person. Cancer doesn’t pick its victims. He was gone when I was young, and I learned what a funeral was because of him. I was 8 and half, old enough to miss him for a lifetime. Had he died before, I wouldn’t have memories. I would feel no pain. But I wouldn’t have a father in my life. And I had a father.

I had a father who was both firm and fun. Someone who would tell a joke before grounding me. That way, I wouldn’t feel so bad. Someone who kissed me on the forehead before I went to sleep. A habit which I passed on to my children. Someone who forced me to support the same football team he supported, and who explained things better than my mother. Do you know what I mean? A father like that is someone to be missed.

He never told me he was going to die. Even when he was lying on a hospital bed with tubes all over him, he didn’t say a word. My father made plans for the next year even though he knew he wouldn’t be around in the next month. Next year, we would go fishing, we would travel, we would visit places we’ve never been. Next year would be an amazing year. We lived the same dream.

I believe — actually I’m sure — he thought this should bring luck. He was a superstitious man. Thinking about the future was the way he found to keep hope alive. The bastard made me laugh until the very end. He knew about it. He didn’t tell me. He didn’t see me crying.

And suddenly, the next year was over before it even started.

My mother picked me up at school and we went to the hospital. The doctor told the news with all the sensitivity that doctors lose over the years. My mother cried. She did have a tiny bit of hope. As I said before, everyone does. I felt the blow. What does it mean? Wasn’t it just a regular disease, the kind of disease doctors heal with a shot? I hated you, dad. I felt betrayed. I screamed with anger in the hospital, until I realized my father was not around to ground me. I cried.

Then, my father was once again a father to me. With a shoebox under her arm, a nurse came by to comfort me. The box was full of sealed envelopes, with sentences where the address should be. I couldn’t understand exactly what was going on. The nurse then handed me a letter. The only letter that was out of the box.

“Your dad asked me to give you this letter. He spent the whole week writing these, and he wants you read it. Be strong.” the nurse said, holding me.

The envelope read WHEN I’M GONE. I opened it.

Son,

If you’re reading this, I’m dead. I’m sorry. I knew I was going to die.

I didn’t want to tell you what was going to happen, I didn’t want to see you crying. Well, it looks like I’ve made it. I think that a man who’s about to die has the right to act a little bit selfish.

Well, as you can see, I still have a lot to teach you. After all, you don’t know crap about anything. So I wrote these letters for you. You must not open them before the right moment, OK? This is our deal.

I love you. Take care of your mom. You’re the man of the house now.

Love, dad.

PS: I didn’t write letters to your mom. She’s got my car.

He made me stop crying with his bad handwriting. Printing was not easy back then. His ugly writing, which I barely understood, made me feel calm. It made me smile. That’s how my father did things. Like the joke before the grounding.

That box became the most important thing in the world for me. I told my mother not to open it. Those letters were mine and no one else could read them. I knew all the life moments written on the envelopes by heart. But it took a while for these moments to happen. And I forgot about it.

Seven years later, after we moved to a new place, I had no idea where I put the box. I couldn’t remember it. And when we don’t remember something, we usually don’t care about it. If something goes lost in your memory, It doesn’t mean you lost it. It simply doesn’t exist anymore. It’s like change in the pockets of your trousers.

And so it happened. My teenage years and my mother’s new boyfriend triggered what my father had anticipated a long time before. My mother had several boyfriends, and I always understood it. She never married again. I don’t know why, but I like to believe that my father had been the love of her life. This boyfriend, however, was worthless. I thought she was humiliating herself by dating him. He had no respect for her. She deserved something a lot better than a guy she met at a bar.

I still remember the slap she gave me after I pronounced the word “bar”. I’ll admit that I deserved it. I learned that over the years. At the time, when my skin was still burning from the slap, I remembered the box and the letters. I remembered a specific letter, which read “WHEN YOU HAVE THE WORST FIGHT EVER WITH YOUR MOM”.

I ransacked my bedroom looking for it, which earned me another slap in the face. I found the box inside a suitcase lying on top of the wardrobe. The limbo. I looked through the letters, and realized that I had forgotten to open WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST KISS. I hated myself for doing that, and I decided that would be the next letter I’d open. WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY came right next in the pack, a letter I was hoping to open really soon. Eventually I found what I was looking for.

Now apologize to her.

I don’t know why you’re fighting and I don’t know who’s right. But I know your mother. So a humble apology is the best way to get over this. I’m talking about a down-on-your-knees apology.

She’s your mother, kid. She loves you more than anything in this world. Do you know that she went through natural birth because someone told her that it would be the best for you? Have you ever seen a woman giving birth? Do you need a bigger proof of love than that?

Apologize. She’ll forgive you.

Love, dad.

My father was not a great writer, he was just a bank clerk. But his words had a great impact on me. They were words that carried more wisdom than all of my 15 years of age at the time. (That wasn’t very hard to achieve, though).

I rushed to my mother’s room and opened the door. I was crying when she turned her head to look me in the eyes. She was also crying. I don’t remember what she yelled at me. Probably something like “What do you want?” What I do remember is that I walked towards her holding the letter my father wrote. I held her in my arms, while my hands crumpled the old paper. She hugged me, and we both stood in silence.

My father’s letter made her laugh a few minutes later. We made peace and talked a little about him. She told me about some of his most eccentric habits, such as eating salami with strawberries. Somehow, I felt he was sitting right next to us. Me, my mother and a piece of my father, a piece he left for us, on a piece of paper. It felt good.

It didn’t take long before I read WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY

Congratulations, son.

Don’t worry, it gets better with time. It always sucks the first time. Mine happened with an ugly woman…who was also a prostitute.

My biggest fear is that you’d ask your mother what virginity is after reading what’s on the letter. Or even worse, reading what I just wrote without knowing what jerking off is (you know what it is, right?). But that’s none of my business.

Love, dad.

My father followed me through my entire life. He was with me, even though he was not near me. His words did what no one else could: they gave me strength to overcome countless challenging moments in my life. He would always find a way to put a smile on my face when things looked grim, or clear my mind during those angry moments.

WHEN YOU GET MARRIED made me feel very emotional. But not so much as WHEN YOU BECOME A FATHER.

Now you’ll understand what real love is, son. You’ll realize how much you love her, but real love is something you’ll feel for this little thing over there. I don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl. I’m just a corpse, I’m not a fortune teller.

Have fun. It’s a great thing. Time is gonna fly now, so make sure you’ll be around. Never miss a moment, they never come back. Change diapers, bathe the baby, be a role model to this child. I think you have what it takes to be an amazing father, just like me.

The most painful letter I read in my entire life was also the shortest letter my father wrote. While he wrote those four words, I believe he suffered just as much as I did living through that moment. It took a while, but eventually I had to open WHEN YOUR MOTHER IS GONE.

She is mine now.

A joke. A sad clown hiding his sadness with a smile on his makeup. It was the only letter that didn’t make me smile, but I could see the reason.

I always kept the deal I had made with my father. I never read letters before their time. With the exception of WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU’RE GAY. Since I never thought I’d have to open this one, I decided to read it. It was one of the funniest letters, by the way.

What can I say? I’m glad I’m dead.

Now, all joking aside, being half-dead made me realize that we care too much about things that don’t matter much. Do you think that changes anything, son?

Don’t be silly. Be happy.

I would always wait for the next moment, the next letter. The next lesson my father would teach me. It’s amazing what a 27 year old man can teach to an 85 year old senior like me.

Now that I am lying on a hospital bed, with tubes in my nose and my throat thanks to this damn cancer, I run my fingers on the faded paper of the only letter I didn’t open. The sentence WHEN YOUR TIME COMES is barely visible on the envelope.

I don’t want to open it. I’m scared. I don’t want to believe that my time is near. It’s a matter of hope, you know? No one believes they’re gonna die.

I take a deep breath, opening the envelope.

Hello, son. I hope you’re an old man now.

You know, this letter was the easiest to write, and the first I wrote. It was the letter that set me free from the pain of losing you. I think your mind becomes clearer when you’re this close to the end. It’s easier to talk about it.

In my last days here I thought about the life I had. I had a brief life, but a very happy one. I was your father and the husband of your mother. What else could I ask for? It gave me peace of mind. Now you do the same.

My advice for you: you don’t have to be afraid

PS: I miss you

Just something I found online. Then i decided to share it here.

532,"I once told a guest, extremely rudely, to get out of my house, for a perfectly logical request from their side.

This was a few years back, right after I completed my post-graduation. I was a bachelor then, living alone in an apartment quite close to my office. Quite naturally, my apartment became the meeting hub every friday. A few of us colleagues would get together, have a few drinks, order in food, chit chat and generally have a good time. It was fun!

As a bachelor, I didn't have too many rules during these parties, so people could pretty much do as they pleased. So, cigarettes were smoked, the occasional drink was spilled, food was accidentally dropped etc. It would all be cleaned up the following morning, so it didn't really bother me.

About an year after I joined, a girl joined our team. So, for the next party at my house, she was invited too. There we were, all of us, sitting in my drawing room, doing what we always did. Then, I lit a cigarette.

As soon as I blew the first puff, she said, ""Do you mind smoking outside. I don't like the smoke"". I don't know whether it was the alcohol, or the fact that I was rather deeply sunk into the bean bag and hence feeling lazy to get up, but I said no to going outside. Once again, she asked politely, ""please, it hurts my eyes"". I don't know what it was that got into me that day, but I instantaneously shouted, ""GET OUT"".

The moment I said it, everybody around the room stared at me and then one of them told me that it was extremely rude. They couldn't believe what I had just said, because they'd never really seen me do anything like this before.

To her credit, she calmly said, ""that was uncalled for"" and sat there silently. She probably understood that this wasn't the real me.

For myself, I knew that what I had done was just plain horrible. I couldn't understand what had happened to me in that moment. Yet, my ego kept me from apologising to her immediately. ""It's your house"", said that ugly voice in my head, ""you have the right to smoke wherever you want and ask whoever to leave"".

Yet, as the minutes passed, that voice  disappeared. I apologised to her, and quite profusely at that, later in the evening.

That girl is now my wife."

I stepped out of a shop and was about to start my two wheeler when I found a kid nearly 5-6 year old asking me ""Didi aap mujhe station ke pass chhod doge kya?"" (Sister, can you please drop me near railway station?). His clothes looked old and he was carrying a big packet which appeared heavy. ""Sure"" I replied, ""Would it be possible to sit in the pillion?"" I asked. He nodded.
On the way, he told me that his name is Chetan, his father is a mechanic who works in a small shop and he,his mother and his two sisters live near railway station. He also mentioned that he has just started going to school and he went to market to buy some households as his little sister was not well and so his mother could not go out.

When we reached the destination after getting down he thanked me and with shining eyes he told me ""Didi pata hai, aaj mai pehli baar gaadi me baitha. Mai aapko kabhi nahi bhuloonga"" (You know,this is the first time I sat in a two wheeler. I'll never forget you). 

I never ever felt that satisfaction again.

541,"Story : ""Gave an auto (~cab) driver 100 bucks not to drive.""

There was this girl I really liked, back in college. We had made plans to meet for lunch. Her roommate dropped her off at the restaurant we were supposed to meet. We had lunch and had a delightful conversation about worldly things. 

When it was time to leave, I told her that I could drop her back to her hostel on my motorbike. She was... is, a very joyful and charming lady, but had one flaw - she was very practical about things. You see, the restaurant was at the center with her hostel and mine being on opposite sides. So in her words, ""It doesn't make any sense for you to go that way and double back to your hostel"" 

Like all men my age, who fought tooth and nail with their fathers to get the bike that they wanted, I didn't mind driving a few extra miles even in the absence of a gorgeous pillion as she. With her - I could go 500 miles, and I could go 500 more...

For once though (may be just for kicks) luck was on my side. A strike was declared that day for all public transportation, which we knew nothing about. She tried hailing a couple of autos (for the uninitiated, autos are just like cabs, but on three wheels, with built in vibrators under each seat, and have a licence to thrill on Indian roads).

None of the auto drivers were willing to drive, owing to the strike. A single one who did agree to drive, was charging 4x the usual fare. I told her, ""It doesn't make sense to spend so much money... You'll just be encouraging them to exploit others"".

She pointed at one auto that stood a little ahead on the road, and said ""Tell you what? If that guy agrees to drive for 2x the fare or below, I'll take it. Otherwise, you can drive me to the hostel.""

We walked up to the auto and she asked him, ""How much would you charge for driving up to XYZ hostel?""

He said, ""Rs. 80"". 

The actual fare was around Rs 35 to Rs 40. He was cutting it close on the 2x criteria.

While she was debating whether to take the auto or not, I panicked. I took out a 100 rupee note, and told the auto driver, ""I'll give you 100 bucks not to drive her.""

The auto driver was quite sharp. He didn't waste time in asking stupid questions, like ""Why?"". He just snatched the note out of my hand, and drove away.

She turned to me and said, ""Why the hell did you do that for?""

I gave a sheepish grin, ""I just felt like driving you back."" 

By this time she had started punching me, ""You're insane! And stupid! And insane! You could have just said so! What about all that talk of not encouraging them to exploit others? You could have donated that money to a good cause!""

I took the fact that she was walking towards my bike and not walking away from me as a good sign, and replied ""I did donate it for a good cause.""

She caught my grin, and returned a goofy laugh, ""You're insane!""

Let me be honest. We do not think well of Pakistan. I have known some Muslims who moved to Pakistan and were extremely unhappy and moved back. We have our own set of problems here but do not face discrimination in everyday life. 

As a Muslim, I can aspire to be the prime minister of India one day. I can aspire to become an actor, a businessman. Anything I want to be. I know as long as I educate myself and pursue my dream I will be able to succeed. 

India has tried and been successful on many levels with being a secular state. Sure we have our own problems but who doesn't. 

Today I have a job, a family, I live in a good home in a society where mainly Hindus reside but have never felt like they have tried to  push me out of any of the activities they are doing. 

I also know of examples Pakistanis pick against Indian Hindus saying someone like Shabana Azmi was not allowed to buy a flat in a Hindu dominated society. To which I have to say that there are very few such instances that actually take place. 

I will also say that all kinds of Muslims are able to exist in peace in India which is impossible to happen in Pakistan. We are proud to be from India - a secular state where all kinds of religions exist in peace and always have.

.
.

I took an Indigo flight from Hyderabad which took me to Varanasi via Delhi on the morning of May 10th, 2014 to attend a friend's wedding. It was the last day of campaigning in Varanasi for Lok Sabha Elections. From Delhi, Anurag Thakur (BJP MP) boarded the flight and sat diagonally across me. He seemed like a nice person and had another person/assistant/bodyguard along with him, but he maintained privacy and did not talk to people around him. 

I had to return on the evening of May 12 (election day), 6:35 Indigo flight. There were no taxis available to the airport which was very far off from the city, as it was the 'D-day'. So a friend offered to drop me at the airport, but at 9:00 am in the morning. I was left with no choice, so I reached the airport around 9 in the morning. The CISF personnel allowed me to get in the terminal building. I stayed there for the entire day as my flight was the last one of the day. During the day I saw Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi at the airport with a few supporters/bodyguards, using the VIP lounge and honestly his attitude was intimidating.

Finally it was time when I had to go through the boarding process. I saw one lean fellow with shirt un-tucked, a pair of chappals, standing almost last in the queue. I think there were one or two supporters who looked like normal people. A few people offered him to move ahead in the queue but he politely declined. This person was 'Arvind Kejriwal'. I went and said, ""Hello Sir"" and shook hands, he reciprocated very well. People by then were clicking photos, and he kept smiling and returning the wishes.

I would say, I felt enthralled. I never thought that an ex-CM and sitting MLA (edited) would meet people with so much warmth.
He was like any other AAM AADMI......

This incident is about one of my friend's experience during his school days. As part of English exam, there was always a section to make sentence with a particular given word and this was a common thing as part of all English exams till 5th standard. 

Suppose the word given is mightier, the answer should be something like the below :

Pen is mightier than the sword.

In one of the exams , there were 3 words which my friend didn't know what it meant ( obviously you need to know the meaning of it to make proper sentences ) so he thought and thought but couldn't get hold of anything.

Finally he decided to answer it in a rather tricky way. All the sentences were as below :

1. My teacher asked me to frame sentence using ""Word1""
2. My teacher asked me to frame sentence using ""Word2""
3. My teacher asked me to frame sentence using ""Word3""

When he received the paper , he was awarded half the mark for all of it but with a comment not to do it in future."

My father came out in the balcony, and I asked him to throw me my jacket which was kept on my bed. 

While he went inside, two good looking guys passed by our scooty, my friend and I started staring at them and talking about them. We didn't realize that my father is standing in the balcony calling us, to catch the jacket.

Down came the jacket , directly on the road, in the sand.

14th February, 2009. Valentine's Day.
I am 17, and it's the first time I have a date on valentine's. My dad kinda knows I have a girlfriend, but it has not been explicitly spelled out to him yet.

Being a weekend, a family movie outing has been planned. Ridiculously priced multiplex tickets for a ridiculous movie have been purchased.

I want to go on the date, but don't know how to bail out from the movie. The date was last minute, because her parents decided to go for a social. I get my best buddy to give me a pep talk, grow a pair and walk up to my dad.

""Dad, I was wondering if I could skip the movie tonight..""

""Why? The tickets are already booked!""

""Umm.. My friend wants to grab dinner together.. because.. its valentine's..""

With a straight face, my dad looks at me and says,
""Spending time with the family is important too... But I get your dilemma, so let's do a coin toss and decide.""

I am thinking that's kinda reasonable. I told my girlfriend it would be really hard for me to make it, so a 50% chance seems like great odds.
""Let me get a coin.""

Dad fumble a bit with his wallet. He can't seem to find a coin.

""There is no coin... I have an alternative though. I'll pull out a Rs 500 (~$10) note, and you guess the last digit of the serial number - odd or even. If you get it right, you get to go.""

Fair enough. I shut my eyes, remember my girlfriends phone number's last digit, it's odd, so I call ""Odd.""

The note ends with an even digit.

 Ridiculous movie it is.

""Hang on, let's do it one more time. Pick again.""

The second last digit of her number is even, so I call ""Even"".

Dad pulls out another note, and sure enough it is even. I am now expecting a best of three.

""Here you go. Have a great night.""
He hands me both the notes and walks away with the very same straight face. I know he's grinning on the inside though."

Sometimes it will feel weird when you realize you spent so much time with someone you are no longer connected to, but that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.

You are exactly where you’re supposed to be. We all are. When life takes something from us, it is only to create space for something new to enter in our life. If one looks back at all the failures, setbacks, and conflicts in life, we will see that all of it was required for us to be exactly where we are now.

Don’t let past relationships ruin your future. Don’t let someone or something that didn’t make it in your life continue to hurt you. If you do, you’re still giving a portion of your life to something that no longer exists – it’s like letting your happiness slip into a black hole. Learn the lesson, release the pain, and move on.

Scars remind us of where we have been, not where we are headed. Learn from your relationship lessons, and turn your wounds into wisdom.

Ans. Very interesting deadlock.
Many years ago, a Law teacher came across a student who was willing to learn but was unable to pay the fees. The student struck a deal saying, ""I will pay your fee the day I win my first case in the court"".

Teacher agreed and proceeded with the law course. When the course was finished and teacher started pestering the student to pay up the fee, the student reminded him of the deal and pushed days.

Fed up with this, the teacher decided to sue the student in the court of law and both of them decided to argue for themselves.
The teacher put forward his argument saying:

""If I win this case, as per the court of law, the student has to pay me as the case is about his non-payment of dues.
And if I lose the case, the student will still pay me because he would have won his first case...
So either way I will get the money"".
Equally brilliant, the student argued back saying:

""If I win the case, as per the court of law, I don't have to pay anything to the teacher as the case is about my non-payment of dues.

And if I lose the case, I don't have to pay him because I haven't won my first case yet....

So either way, I am not going to pay the teacher anything"".

This is one of the greatest paradoxes ever recorded.
Who is right and who is the winner?

This is part of ancient Greek history. The lawyer teacher was Protagoras (c.485-415 BCE) and the student was Euthalos. This is known as Protagoras's Paradox. This case was not solved. The most interesting part - this is still debated (even today) in law schools as a logic problem..."

569,"Ques: What are the advantages and disadvantages of being too nice to people?
.
.
.

Ans. Once I had a friend who was actually being too nice to people. Here are the don'ts that I had learnt from her :
People take you for granted. They take advantage of you.They don't even consider possibilities of you ever saying 'No' assertively.

You end up making unworthy people a priority in your life.
They don't know to set boundaries. These 'too nice' people are the ones who get hurt the most. They often are treated like 'options'.

Their existence is acknowledged only when people need help because they are always available.

They feel it's better to cry than to be angry; because anger hurts others while tears just flow silently through the soul. It's okay if you are hurt but it's a sin if others are hurt.

They are very expressive. So people find them very predictable, boring and they eventually detach themselves as there is nothing left to explore.

Everybody has an opinion and every opinion matters. They can't just stop caring. They just can't. It really disrupts their internal peace quite often.

They blame themselves if anything ever goes wrong. Because they are too nice to even think of somebody in a wrong way.

Not to forget, Too nice people don't remain too nice till the end. Ultimately even my 'too nice' friend has gone through all of these things that has changed her in a way that she could never go back to being that person she once was. 

In fact she helped me write this answer and I helped her realize."

'Come inside. You said you wanted to marry me even though you haven't even met me. This is the test of your love. There are exactly 8 girls here. You get only one chance to spot me. Go!', she dropped the call. Shit just got real.

I entered inside and took a quick glance. Nothing abnormal or out of the blue. This wasn't going to be easy. I grabbed a seat in the corner so that it gave me a full view of the area. Some heads turned in my direction but only for some nanoseconds.

I looked closely towards each girl: their movements, their style, their voice but nothing clicked. May be this is how Watson felt on days he would travel alone without Sherlock. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine her face by replaying her voice. I realized that I wasn't much of an artist and my Engineering Drawing grades came back to me screaming.

I changed tactics and applied JEE approach. I thought of it as an objective question with eight options instead of four. Elimination method was my personal favourite.

'Too conservative going with the clothing style.' One down.

'Came with her parents: not a chance.' That was easy. Two down.

'Too much into her mobile. She doesn't use WhatsApp or Facebook.' Five to go.

'Continuously checking me out since the beginning of the century.' Definitely a decoy.

'She's with a boy. Could be a friend or brother or boyfriend.' Probable candidate.

'Sorry sir, I don't think you have ordered yet', she replied. I knew it.

'I ordered a romantic date with a beautiful lady so why am I playing Hide-n-Seek, huh?', her cheeks turned into the most delicious colour I have ever seen.

'How do you know? Even my name-tag is different', she chuckled. She had a smile that cuts like a knife.

'Well I have talked to you before and guessed that you were someone who interacted with people on daily basis. Second, you immediately counted all the girls over the phone. So you have to be somewhere you could see every body. Third and the most important if it were someone from the other girls she wouldn't have counted the girl from the billing counter unless she herself was her.

Ans. This was an incident regarding my first date with my first ever girlfriend. I had absolutely zero experience with dating whereas she had dated before. During the beginning of our relationship, we (mainly I) were really busy that I never got enough time to take her out. I was also nervous as I had never dated before. Early into the relationship, we were living around 3 hrs from each other, that it was difficult to meet. She wanted me to take her out. Soon enough I make some free time and agreed for a lunch date.

I got up at 8 in the morning, showered and groomed myself. At 9 I catch an auto rickshaw to the nearest bus stand, from there another bus to another bus stand, from there again another bus to a landmark and from there another auto rickshaw to the destination. The whole journey took around 3 hrs and I was exhausted. When we met, she was extremely happy to see me.
We had an amazing first date, lunch, a walk on a beautiful road with greenery on both sides and watched a movie. I tried my best to keep my ""gentlemanly"" behavior throughout the date.

At around 6 PM, we decide to leave. We take an auto rickshaw to her house (which was again a few kms away) and I drop her home. I had to travel the same route again back to my place. To make things worse, it was raining heavily that night with shin length water. I finally reach home at 11 PM. She admired the fact that I travelled this much just to meet her. When I rang her up to tell her that I've reached..,she told me this...""I have dated many guys before, but none behaved like how you did today. You are a true gentleman. I RESPECT YOU.""

582,"Ques: Is it harder to stay single beyond a certain age?
.
.

Ans. I'm a 29 year old single Indian woman (I can't call myself a girl at 29 now, can I?) I am single because I spent the most of my 20's investing in my career. After graduating from an IIT at 22, I worked for 2 years, joined an IIM for the next 2 years and have been working for the past 3 years now. In retrospect, these 7 years have been very eventful and never did I feel that I should've married during these years.

In fact, probably because I was single, I managed to try out a lot of things during this period: lived in 8 different cities because of my work, landed 3 job offers while in IIM, have been supporting my mother after losing my father unexpectedly, (in fact I've managed to give her a very comfortable life thanks to the immense salary jump I got with my 2nd degree. I doubt if I could've managed that with my previous job or as a married woman.), bought a car, met some very interesting people (big industrialists as well as a celebrity), started sponsoring an underprivileged girl's education, started teaching underprivileged kids.

I feel I've done fine and I don't think I would've swapped these things for a married life. I come from a community which doesn't mind late marriages. My own mother married at 30 so she doesn't force me to marry. She believes in marrying when one is ready and when one feels like marrying the person one has feelings for. Probably this has helped me survive even as I see my friends and juniors getting married and having children, or when strangers ask me about my marital status even before my name.

Given the kind of people Indians are, I doubt if I'd find an Indian guy in my 30's, to marry. But I wouldn't mind it. It's a small world and there're so many opportunities ahead of me. Anything can happen.

As long as I've a family backing me up, I think I can ignore what people say. Apart from that, I don't think I should be affected socially, legally or financially. As for regrets, I can't make a person marry me, but even if I were to die a spinster, I wouldn't regret it because what I did in my 20's helped me support my mother and a few children, and has made me a better person than what I was before. It changed the course of my life.

So answering your question, it's all up to you. If you manage to not yield in to what people say, then its not hard to stay single. As for regretting later, it again depends on what your priorities in life are. Remember, there's something between marrying early and never marrying, it's called marrying when you feel like it."

This one is from IIT Kanpur.

2 years ago I was giving a presentation in front of around 100 (which is a surprisingly good attendance) students, a few TAs and a Prof. The presentation was pretty boring (no surprises there). Suddenly out of nowhere a Gtalk window pops out saying 'Motuuuuuuuuuuu' (fatso). (It was a friend of mine who calls me that affectionately. I am not fat; I am just big) Everybody started laughing all of a sudden. I was pretty embarrassed. The prof silenced everybody and then asked me ""Girlfriend ?"" 

I said ""No sir. Just a friend."" Then he said ""Talk to her."" with a big grin across his face.

That sonovabitch made me chat with her for like 5 minutes and all the while everybody in that lecture hall was laughing his/her (Yeah. We do have girls in IITs) ass off. He made me write all types of cheesy messages and my fellow classmates gave some really nice suggestions (Those bastards). 
It was a week before people started calling me by my name otherwise everybody called me 'Motu'.

I was really embarrassed that day but when I look back, It was one of the funniest things which happened to me during my stay at IITK. That Prof rocked man. Big time."

Soon the train arrived , I boarded the train and I saw that the girl too boarded the same train and the creepy disgusting boys followed her. She was sitting and the 4 boys divided themselves and sat two each on both of her sides. They were passing vulgar comments and were also trying to touch her by passing things between them. The girl was so scared that she wasn't even able to speak up a word. I being a boy, was damn scared too and I didn't know what should I do. I got down at my station and the girl got down at the same station. Soon as she was on the station, the boys circled her again. I grabbed all my guts and went up to the girl and said "" Priyanka, So you are here. You really took long. I was waiting for you for so long now"". I held her hand and just took her away. She didn't even utter a word. I took her out of the station, where her husband was waiting.I dropped her and left.

One day during a speaking tour, Albert Einstein’s driver, who often sat at the back of the hall during his lectures, remarked that he could probably give the lecture himself, having heard it so many times. Sure enough, at the next stop on the tour, Einstein and the driver switched places, with Einstein sitting at the back in his driver’s uniform.
Having delivered a flawless lecture, the driver was asked a difficult question by a member of the audience. “Well, the answer to that question is quite simple,” he casually replied. “I bet my driver, sitting up at the back there, could answer it!”"

Steve Wozniak carries around pads of $2 bills that he tries to pay for things with.  Whenever he goes shopping he just pulls out his pad of bills, tears off the appropriate number of bills, and hands the cashier the bills.  Many people won't accept it because they think it's fake money.
To make them, he buys sheets of $2 bills from the US Treasury and has a local printing company glue them together like a notepad and perforate the bills.  Each $2 bill costs him about $3 to make.
He's been stopped by the Secret Service multiple times, one of the times even being read his Miranda rights.

Why does he do it?  Entirely to confuse people and entertain himself.

This tip applies to text messages.

If you are conversing with someone through texts, and the person says something hurtful or something you don't particularly like, do not reply instantly. Wait for 5 minutes, relax, breathe and then, reply. The wait makes a huge difference! You end up responding in a much more sensible manner and avoiding unnecessary arguments."
596,"What is the most funny or weird scene you have encountered while travelling on Indian Rail?
.
.
.

This might not be that funny and weird if you are Indian, but as a foreigner I found the following extremely funny.
I was traveling home to Mayapur from Kolkata on an Express from Howrah. I was in the second sleeper A/C, as the the general class is too wild for me. I also like my comforts and can afford it, so second A/C is ideal for me.
So we are three in a compartment with reservations for 4.  We are all men in our 50s. At the next stop a gentleman comes in, he has the 4th reservation.
Another funny thing in India - people on buses and trains actually talk to each-other, even if they are strangers. This is a foreign concept in Scandinavia, where I am from. You simply don't address other people you don't know on the train. My mother used to tell me, don't talk to strangers, it's impolite. So when you board a public transport in Scandinavia, there is deadly quiet. The only talk is some hushed conversations here and there between people who travel together.
When you enter a public transportation in India, you are immediately hit by a cacophony of sound. That's the first thing I noticed when I came to live in India - the sound and the noise of people everywhere.
So this new passenger immediately strikes up a conversation with the man next to him. From the few words I know in Bengali I can understand he asks about his kids and his work. It's obvious they haven't met before. They exchange family information for 5-10 minutes, then settle into their news papers. After about half an hour, the last gentleman yawns, puts down his news paper and lies down, folds his legs and puts his head on the thigh of his fellow passenger, who just continue reading his paper as if  it's the most normal thing in the world. He doesn't bat an eye.
All I can do is sit and gawk in disbelief. You try and do that in a train in Denmark, and you are likely to get punched in the nose. It's simply unheard of in that part of the world.
The tolerance of people is quite extraordinary. And you quickly learn tolerance and patience yourself, it's either that or going crazy. I remember the first time I stood in a line for something, and the next man just presses up against you, even though there is ample space. It's quite disturbing to a Scandinavian.
But I have learned to admire the way Indians care for each other, the way they are not afraid of being close and touching each other.
Another thing, one time I was out selling books in down town Copenhagen, and I saw some skin-heads harassing a man, beating and kicking him. Nobody intervened, people just passed by in the busy street, afraid of getting involved.
You try the same in Delhi or Kolkata, immediately a throng of people will gather around , demanding to know what's going on. People are not at all afraid of getting involved.
That's one of the many reasons I love India."

600,"Imagine India. Imagine 1970s. The eastman color era. Love was a taboo then, pre-marital sex an offense to say the least.

There was this girl studying in a very prestigious university, doing her master's. Being the second of 3 daughter's to an army officer, she was high and stable headed; primary focus: studies.

The marriage was arranged with this gentleman in navy, a deep sea diver, six packs and great athlete. Perfect dream boy.

The guy visits her in her university with help of his best friend and her elder sister. They meet, fell in love (it was that quick back then!) and sealed for marriage.
The guy's mother is a typical vamp in this story. She gets a bad intuition of this relationship feeling this will decrease her say in family affairs (the guy had no father) and thus plays a chance. She sends her elder son to her university, made him tell the girl how the guy (the in question to-be-groom) would like her to stay at home and not be the lecturer she was studying to become. Or else, there are many brides waiting for his approval. Girl takes it as insult of her self-respects and breaks the relationship. P.s.: there were no phones then, no medium to verify the information.

The elder brother feels guilty and tells the entire story to the brother. But the ship had sailed off, she had broken all ties!

The guy now visits her university with his best friend and brother, stands in front of her hostel and sings the song he wrote for her in his bad, very hoarse voice. But the song is so beautiful, the girl descends and give him a chance to explain himself.

He then tells the whole story, verifies it from his brother and then proposes her in her university.

I was in ninth grade when the following incident happened with a classmate/friend of mine.
It was winters, our school had a strict policy against cell phones being brought by the students at the school premises. Somebody had tipped one of our lady teachers that somebody had brought a phone to our class. So, there was an impromptu checking of every student in our class. My friend being a trouble-maker was the first one to be checked and as luck would have it, he was having an erection at that moment. The teacher started checking his blazer pockets with her hands, not finding anything she came to his pant pockets, she felt something hard and rigid down 'there'. The teacher suspecting 'it' as a phone furiously asked ""WHAT IS THIS?"". In response, his face got scarlet with extreme embarrassment and kept quiet.

605,"Few years ago, while I was unmarried and was looking for a suitable match I registered myself on matrimonial sites (shaadi dot com and bharat matrimony) with a hope to get a similar minded person and a zero-showoff marriage. Also, my parents were looking for a suitable match via their personal & social connections.

A lot of phone conversations with prospects from the matrimonial sites used to consist of the following things...
It used to get clear in the very first few minutes of the conversation that the very reason why both of us chose to find a match via online matchmaking services was because we were looking for Open Minded, Educated, and Zero-Showoff, Dowry-Free marriage. And I used to get very happy that I am talking to such a modern person.
In the next few minutes details were exchanges. Details related to family, education, professional, misc details about friends and extended families. And till far, the discussion used to be a breeze.
One of the next topics used to be - Career plans after marriage. And I happily used to say that - It will be your choice, I will not interfere in your decision.
On the dowry issue, there was of course an agreement that I will not ask for dowry in any form.
So next I used to ask - So if things work out, when can you get married? The answer used to range from 3 months to a year. Which was absolutely fine.
At this point, almost all the girls I spoke to started taking discussing about the marriage planning, and the discussion used to go like this...
She: So where do you think we should get married?
Me: Either my town or your hometown or a neutral place.

She: I think it would be better if we go for your home town.
Me: Why So?

She: It would be easier for you to make the arrangements, hotel, reception, decorations, etc.
Me: But I thought we are going for a zero-showoff marriage. And I have already decided that I would go for court-marriage, followed by a small reception. And the entire event will be open only to extremely close members of the family and friends (not exceeding 20-25 people from each side).

She: Hmm....that sounds good, but don't you think its too simple shaadi? India mein aisa hota hai kya?
Me: Hota to nahin hai, but we are the ones who need to change things and start such good trends.

She: Ok, and how about jewellery and all?
Me: Whatever you wish you can buy, why would I have any issues with your jewellery. In any case you are one who is going to use it.

She: So, whats your budget?
Me: Budget for what?

She: Jewellery and other gifts which a bride gets from the groom's family.
Me: I thought we are going for a dowry-free marriage?

She: Yeah, but this is Indian custom. Groom's family has to gift jewellery items.
Me: *silence in shock*

{and at this point I had already made up mind, but then thought of testing my patience for a few minutes}

Me: Ok, fine. Agreed. So, lets do it this way. The marriage will be in your hometown. Baarat will consist of around 200 people. Make the arrangements in a good hotel. The marriage arrangements should be taken care by your family. All these expenses will be split between yours and my family. And I guess the expenses would be around 20Lac each side.
She: But thats not possible. Its dowry!

*Totally pissed by now*

Me : So girl, if you have to spend anything its dowry, and if we need to spend something it comes under the purview of Indian Customs! How fair is that?

She: *Hangs Up The Phone*

Its a real story. And I have tried speaking to almost 10-12 girls while I was looking for a suitable match.

Its painful how girls find it absolutely ridiculous to give any dowry (which is great), but then expect a modified form of dowry in return from the groom's family."

607,"Common form of sexism that men face
.
.
.
A few days back I was out for a movie with my friend. A little pretext, it was a good movie hall in a good area and we were sitting on really good (see expensive) seats. The row we were sitting in had 6 seats, we occupied two, the middle two were empty and there was a couple seated in the other corner in a way that the girl sat next to the empty seats. In came a gentleman, well dressed, with popcorn and an iphone 6 in his hands and sat down on the empty seat next to the girl. The man looked decent enough, but alas, he was alone. The moment he sat down, that couple on his right shared a look and exchanged seats among themselves in a split second. The man obviously looked a little hurt and shocked. As if being alone somehow makes him a rapist, as if he needs a female with him to get some kind of a social security clearance. The guy I was with was flabbergasted by this too, even more after I reminded him that this could have happened with him if I wasn't there. 

I see this kind of sexism in little things everyday. Women avoid single men at bus stops, railway stations, in shops, in queues, everywhere. If a single man offers you his seat in metro, he is looked upon with suspicion. If a single man smiles at you, your defenses go up. And lord help him if he tries to strike up a conversation. One time, a male friend of mine tried to help a girl who fell down from her scooter in front of him, she wasn't hurt but still he wanted to make sure. He had just started to ask her if she was okay when the girl got really scared and shouted at him to go away. Would she have done so if he was not a man? 

While this may not seem that big of a deal, it is.
Think of it this way, you're a girl and you see two seats in front of you, one is next to a couple and the other is next to a single man. Where would you sit? In today's society, us girls are tuned in a way that most of us would sit besides the couple. We tend to associate a suspicion, a risk factor with a man who is by himself, no matter how decent he looks. No I'm in no way implying that this, as girls, is our fault. It's not. In today's times, we cannot let our guard down, one cannot ignore one's own safety just to be nice. But yes, being overly suspicious of everyone around you is helping no one."

Your education in IIT is largely subsidized by the Indian taxpayer. But after we Indians pay for your education, you are taken away by America ( or Europe) who benefit from your technical knowledge, which was imparted by us.
Higher education is very expensive in the West. So at a small fraction of the cost of educating you in their own country, the Westerners take away our best brains. That is no doubt a considerable saving for them, though no doubt at our expense.

The mother, a farmer tending cattle, and the girl were from a small village near Trichy. Due to some misguidance, they did not know that the counselling was at Agriculture University in Coimbatore. Luckily for the girl, some early morning walkers turned up who informed her that she was to be in Coimbatore rather than Chennai. 

The girl had scored 1017/ 1200 though suffering from illness during the +2 exams, and had somehow got misguided to attend interview at Chennai.

Thankully, one of the walkers offered to sponsor to send both of them by flight immediately to Coimbatore. Other walkers pitched in – they asked friends/ contacts to inform the Registrar about the case. By 7.50 am it was agreed to look into the case. Meanwhile breakfast was provided to the mother and daughter . 

The sponsor of the flight tickets transported them to the airport by 8.15 am to board the 10.05 am flight to Coimbatore. Arrangements were made to pick them up from Coimbatore airport at 11.40 am by car. They reached the University counselling venue by 12.15 pm

The Registrar had made an arrangement to ensure that the candidate got fair counselling. Through the counselling the candidate was offered B.Sc. – bio technology in TNAU – Cbe. at 2.00 pm the same day.

I even got in a fight with 3 guys alone who used to tease he outside our tution classes.
While my quest to impress her was at its prime i was using all arrows from my quiver of whimsy.
One one fine day we both were returning to our classes i saw a kid playing on the street wearing that dress which shaktiman used to wear.
(SHAKTIMAN an indian super hero whose costumes were popular in those days.)

That kid was almost looked like the one in picture.
I would normally not go and talk to some random kid but as she was with me and my urge to impress her took me to that kid.
Me : ohh he is so cute.
She :yeah she is so cute.
 
I went near to that kid kneeled down on my knees and i asked him
""Hey shaktimaan wats your name...""

Kid with looked at me with a poker face with no expression on his face.

I felt like losing the quest and  my impression sliding down a drain so i decided to give one more try.Now i asked him
Hey shaktiman ......show me how to spin like a shaktiman.

As i was smiling and hoping he will spin like a shaktimaan .....a sudden big nasty slap came on my face with a thunderous noise and i fell on the ground.As I was getting my shit together that small kid ran away.

Fast forward to '02. I was driving from Bandra to Jogeshwari. Was really hungry after having a long day at work. Thought of going by Mithibai because more than anything, just going by that road is quite mesmerizing!

So I parked my car and ordered a dosa. While the guy was making a dosa for me, I was just staring at the college building. So many memories, so many awesome memories! Life was so much better. You didn't have to give a shit about anything going wrong in life. 

Anyways, while I am lost in my past on the dimly lit street, trying to escape my pathetic present, someone taps on my shoulder. Who could it be? The dosa guy?

NO! Guess what? It was my FIRST LOVE! She was right there! I could not believe my eyes. I just wanted to kiss her right there! She came back to the city a year ago and was doing her Masters at Mithibai. What an unbelievable coincidence! You unexpectedly meet your long lost love right where it all started!!

We had two dosas that night. She was staying at her aunt's place and we exchanged our landline numbers. 

Got married in 2004 and today we are raising two beautiful kids. Gotta make sure they go to Mithibai, right?"

.
.

My dad is an IITian. 

JEE:
We both have the same JEE rank!! Exact to the last digit (It has 3 digits in case your are wondering :/). Did  he make me study to get into IIT? No. I was myself motivated to clear  JEE. Infact he would tell me that it was ok not to get selected as it is  not the end of world. 

Hobbies:
He once visited me at the campus and we played table tennis :/. He still beats me at chess :'(. He used to listen to pink floyd and I could find lots of people in campus who still do. We have fountainhead, asimov and other books. He encouraged me to play guitar, that is something he could not do. 

Treasure hunt at home:
We had an old box with lots of books from his IIT days. I did not have to purchase SL Loni trigonometry and co-ordinate geometry, Irodov, Resnick Hallidey and some bibles. They were just there! 

My grades:
Even during my IIT days, I used to have low cpi (7.0 first sem). I would not get any flak for not studying. I would just say that I am not concentrating much on acads as I am doing typical IITian things (yeah they dont include studies). He would just say don't get FR. I did not get any.

Me whining:
Disadvantage could be (well this is personal opinion and I very much like being appreciated), sometimes people just say: hey you are his son, so you definitely would be in IIT. 

So yeah there are lots of benefits. You can discuss about anything and he can relate to it. You can have  arguments in the same style as those you have with your batchmates. So  you are at natural advantage in convincing or being convinced. That is  just awesome. I share some common hobbies with my dad and some I developed on my own. My discussions with him are just like what we have with a senior.

Hope it helps.

Once I was travelling in train with the status of my ticket being wait list 1. I thought since I my ticket is wait listed, I will not get a seat unless I pay. But I did not have so much money to spend on bribe because I had to travel a long way and there was no way I could survive without money. The TTE came and saw my ticket and proceeded to check others. I saw so many people ready to pay so much to get a confirmed berth. I just saw him passing by. I had no hope. I was not even thinking about it. But then half an hour later to my surprise, TTE came asking for me.. And he alloted me the seat of a person who missed the train. I could still see people behind him asking for a seat for thousands. But he denied. He told it follows a sequence and he will not take bribe for allotting seats. I felt extremely proud of such a person living in such a corrupt environment. And the best thing was, that person was young, must be in his late twenties..

Plans the whole commute route from our home to that location, just to keep a track of the exact time it takes to reach the destination.
To an Indian father, it does not matter,

if Google maps will find out the shortest possible route to the interview location.
An Indian father will still do it all for you.

642,"I am one of those guys who never gawk at women. In fact, I am so discrete most of the times that my previous two girlfriends actually pointed the 'fact' out that I don't check out girls.

Honestly speaking, I do check out women.

I'll tell you about something that happened a couple of days ago.

I was travelling in the Delhi metro alone. 
Now most of the times when I'm alone, I immerse myself in music. This time was an exception and I just stood there observing people around me.

There was this girl standing not more than 10 feet away from me. She was one of the most beautiful people I've ever laid eyes upon. I couldn't tell much about how she was as a person (obvious), but she was physically attractive and possessed a bewitching personality.

I definitely checked her out.

What I didn't do was:

Gawk at her with my mouth wide open, making her and/or other people around uncomfortable.
Change my position to go stand near her.
Invade her privacy in any way.
Make any obscene gesture to render her (and me) embarassed.
When she got down a couple of stations before me, I didn't follow her going off my own route.

In fact, I pen down all of the above things just because I'm answering a question and trying to make my point.
In that moment, I didn't think to myself ""I shouldn't go and stand near her. That would be wrong"" or ""I shouldn't stare at her like an animal.""

In that moment, it was all instinctive. I couldn't fathom invading her privacy.

It's been 48 hours since that incident and I'm positive I won't be able to recognize her if we happen to meet sometime in the future.

Checking out and ogling at someone are two different things.

Similarly,

Checking out and objectifying women are two different things as well.

I don't get attracted towards just the physical aspects of a stranger. 

Sometimes, I see a girl reading a book in the metro and I instantly separate her from the rest. (especially if it's a book I like)
Sometimes, someone's attire is what sets her apart from the rest of the group for me.
It's not always the physical aspects of a girl that grab my attention. 

There is absolutely no problem in 'checking' people out. Eveyone should just know their boundaries.

The two golden rules for checking out are:

Don't invade someone's privacy.
Don't make them feel uncomfortable.

I personally wouldn't mind if I catch a person looking at me, as long as they don't make me feel violated.

Same should be the case with women. If you expect me to look down at my shoes everytime a woman passes in front of me, then that's not gonna happen.
Call it patriarchy, call it misogyny, call it anti-feminism, call it anything you want.
I will observe people when in a public sphere and it would include the occasional thought to myself, ""Hey, that girl was really attractive.""

I don't find anything wrong with it, morally or legally."

Then a professor comes, shows no interest in you, plugs his pen drive in the computer, opens his presentation and starts reading them in a monotonous tone. You wonder if these are the best professors of the country, my coaching's teachers were far better than this. You look around and wonder more by finding your classmates are struggling to copy slides before the professor changes them. You console yourself that may be this professor is idiot but others would be good.

Then another professor comes and the story repeats. Your hopes of being taught by best professors shatters painfully and then with time the desire to become best engineers turns into desire of surviving the semester and getting out of this place as soon as possible.

.
.
.

Ans. In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Wall Street Journal ran a post about the security condition in India. In that post, there was a quote from a top security consultant who was consulting American tourists heading to India. I will just try to paraphrase his quote from my memory.
You should be worried about traveling to India. You should especially be worried about driving to the airport - the riskiest part of the trip.
You are many times more likely to die of a road accident in the US than be victim of a terrorist attack in India. The riskiest part of your trip lies in the road between your home and your airport. If you don't fear that, the rest of the trip has far less odds of hurting you.
That said, follow the basic safety guidelines [avoid traveling alone in unfamiliar surroundings, avoid walking in the dark, don't get into a stranger's vehicle, don't eat what a stranger offers, don't advertise your plans in the public, don't flaunt expensive things]
PS: There is no ISIS operation in India. And Syria is far more closer to UK, France and rest of Europe than India. The distance between Agra and Syria where ISIS operates is more than the distance between Boston and Honduras. If you don't usually worry about the drug cartels of Central America while in the US, you don't have to worry about ISIS while enjoying the Taj.

Ans. Years ago a friend was on a plane in the aisle seat heading to LA. A really stinky guy climbed all over him after having caused all kinds of havoc with the over head lockers. Before the plane took off the guy was asleep on my friend's shoulder slumped every where and having a snore. My friend put up with this but his mind ran ammock. He hated this guy for a long list of reasons he was unpleasant, smelly- had body odour and bad breath, more than a little racism, and some sour commentary on his possible religion.
After about two hours the meals came and the flight attendant woke the guy up. He had the worst manners and ate like he had never seen food. After his first meal he asked the attendant if he could possibly get another. Then he gobbled down a second one and seemed to relax just a little. He turned to my friend and said ""That was good"", he had been starving and had not eaten or slept in three days.
At this point my friend got curios and asked ""What happened to your money?"". He goes ""I spent all of it on medicines for my patients. I knew I would fly out today so it did not matter that much."" Alert now my friend asks if he was a nurse. Mr. Smelly replied that he was an ophthalmologist and had been in India.
The doctor got out only a few letters ""Bho"" before my friend's brain imploded- the Union Carbide Disaster. Thousands of poor people blinded and injured, and shortages of qualified help.
My friend then asked what he would do when he got home. The doctor's response was the next big shock. He said ""I'm going home to auction my house in Orange County and then I'm going back for as long as the money lasts"".

Ans. A 10-year-old boy decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.
The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn’t understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move. “Sensei,” the boy finally said, “Shouldn’t I be learning more moves?” “This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you’ll ever need to know,” the Sensei replied.
Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training. Several months later, the Sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.
This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be over-matched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the Sensei intervened. “No,” the Sensei insisted, “Let him continue.” Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament.
He was the champion. On the way home, the boy and Sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.
“Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?”
“You won for two reasons,” the Sensei answered. “First, you’ve almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.”
The boy’s biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.

My uncle lived 70 years without sex or marriage. never had sex in his life. He was totally fine to us ( at least infront of us) until we found him dead on his bed. 

The reason is because he had a girlfriend who dumped him when he was 17, so he hated relationships at all. Never had sex once in his life. He was a teacher and a normal guy. 

He was living alone in his apartment with no one for the last 20 years of his life (he knew how to cook and everything). He was not depressed and socialized very well and had friends, but he just didn't want a wife or children not even sex ( he was straight if you care). 

He died alone too, we missed him for 2 days and didn't answer the phone so we broke the door and found him peacefully sleeping his last sleep. 

So don't worry, you can do fine with no sex. I gave you a true analogy to answer your question (Don't collapse it Quora!).

664,"What are some confidence hacks?
.
.
.

There are some pretty good answers below.  I'll throw in my two cents.

As someone who has struggled with self-esteem issues, and social anxiety, I'll tell you what my Muay Thai teacher told me.

The secret of confidence, is this:  Confidence is knowledge.  Knowledge of a likely result.  When you put food in your mouth, you do so confidently because you know from experience that it will nourish you.  When you put one foot in front of the other, you do so confidently, because history tells you that that's a good way to ambulate from one point to another.

Much the same, the only way to be confident in social situations is to experience them.  If you want to be confident asking out a boy, or a girl, try asking out boys and girls.  See what works.  You'll become confident.

You want to try a new sport?  Try the new sport.  If you like it, you'll end up playing confidently, because you'll know how to play.

Anxiety, uncertainty, fear.  These all come from the unknown.  Educate yourself.  Experiment.  Learn.  With knowledge will come confidence.

665,"Recently I read many articles flooded on social media regarding BIhar election results , person becoming ministers ,education level etc etc .
And then also reading that secretary/ IAS / IPS etc will have to report him / her etc etc 

And this reminded me of the lecture given by our present  Hon'ble President ;Shri Pranab Mukherjee .

He in a lecture said that in 1970's he asked an IAS officer who was secretary that time that despite so much of studies , qualification and all  you are standing before me and I am sitting on the chair . I am not that qualified and enriched like you  but still you are reporting me every thing and without my permission you are not even sitting . He said that he himself is not that qualified and you are ,but still this scenario !!!

That particular officer at that time gave a very good reply . 
The officer said that ,sir I am respecting the chair on which you are sitting . He said sir I am respecting the feelings , opinion and hope of millions of people who have elected you . I am not respecting you but I am respecting those millions of citizen. India being a democratic country , here the government is for the people , by the people and of the people . So ultimately it's the people who are ruling . So it's the mandate whom I am respecting and following .

This answer is even valid today and particularly holds true .

667,"Q: Why does India lag behind in attracting international tourists? What should we do to improve the situation?

A: I am a tourist. I am in India right now, so feel that I can offer the best advice. 

1.don't stare at me everywhere I go. If I leave the room, I get stared at. By a lot of people. It's wierd and it's the only country I have experienced this. 

2.don't look at my wife like she is a piece of meat. This happens all of the time. Never happens in any other country. In fact, if someone looked at her like that in our own country, she would break their jaw. 

3.don't feel that you have the right to grope my wife in large crowds. This has happened in several different states. 

4.respect women. Not just tourists, but your own. 

5.don't assume that we are millionaires. We have left our jobs to travel the world. We saved money, lived in a small place, lived cheap for years so we could visit India and other countries. Everyone from tour operators, rickshaw drivers, shop owners, hotel owners, even some chai wallahs want to charge us more than Indians pay. On many occasions, chai wallahs tell other locals to put their money away-we don't have to speak Hindi to understand that we have just paid for their tea. 

6.don't charge us more to get in places. Taj mahal rs20 for Indian rs750 for tourist. Wha?  Many Indian tourists are wealthier than us. 

7.clean your country up, or at least develop a different attitude on waste disposal and start a revolution to put pressure on the government.  There is a bin on the train. Why throw rubbish out the window? 

There are many more points, but these are the main ones. Respect us and don't rip us off. We are not stupid. 

India is challenging to visit, but we do love it. You asked for ways to improve for tourism, so don't take offence, but please listen to these points.

I apologised saying, ""I am sorry; I thought you were my brother.""

I'd only gone to the library to read a book recommended by a friend, but never in my wildest dreams had I thought that there'd be a blackout with a torrential downpour outside, and I'd be stranded with the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. She broke my reverie by sighing loudly. I walked up to her.

She (Sighing): ""Oh no!""

(The state of alertness which darkness engenders, brought out the spontaneous guy in me.)

Me (Curious): ""Are you afraid of ghosts?""
She: ""What? No......I mean..... I don't believe in such stuff!""

Me: ""Me too. But, I don't know why, whenever I am in an old, large, spooky, dark place like this and it's raining outside, the probability of existence of ghosts seems very high.""

She: ""Spooky, large, old, dark."" (She emphasized on each word.)
Me (Clueless): ""Huh? Yeah, that's what I just said.""

She: ""No! Your order of adjectives was wrong.""
Me (Digesting slowly): ""Order... of.... adjectives. Hmm. Is that what this place does to you?""

(She chuckled.) 

She: ""Hi! I am Rose.""
Me:  ""Rose. The noun or the verb?""

(She chortled again.)

She: ""Look, my parents were not that grammar conscious!""
Me:  ""And look how you turned out!""

(We both laughed.)

Me: ""I am Aditya.""

(The librarian brought a candle. By the look on his face, he seemed as freaked out as me; watching two people talk in complete darkness. As opposed to ghosts, crazy people were very much real!)

Me: ""Well, I have heard about candlelight dinners, but candlelight reading sessions are new to me.""

She: ""Don't get any ideas, mister.""
Me:  ""But I thought people came to libraries for ideas, for enlightenment!""

She: ""Funny of you to say 'enlightenment'  during a blackout.""
Me:  ""Hey! Let's not undermine the efforts of the candle. These babies have been very useful to people, you know; to help them bond, have romantic conversations.""

She(mischievously): ""Are you flirting with me?""
Me: ""Yeah. Rule No.1 of Professional Flirting: When you want to flirt with a girl, praise a candle instead!""

(She giggled.)

She: ""What are you reading?""
Me:  ""Your eyes! The most beautiful pair I have ever seen. Now, I can see the flickering of the flame in them. Those glittering pearls have the power to make time stand still!""

She(overwhelmed): ""Wow! That is the most wonderful thing anyone has ever said to me. Now you are definitely flirting with me!""
Me: ""Well. I took the last line from the Sci-Fi book I am reading.""

(She laughed really hard.)

She: ""You plagiarist!""
Me:  ""Hey! I just gave credit to the source!""

She: ""But you used it to try to impress me before mentioning that!""
Me:  ""So you are impressed by me now?""

She: ""Didn't you hear the word 'try' ?""
Me:  ""Okay, let's see, I am in this candle lit room alone, with a beautiful, intelligent girl who has a good sense of humor and it is raining outside.You can't blame me for trying. I am not a wuss!""

She: ""So what are you?""
Me:  ""I am not a self-pompous person either. People are free to judge.""

She: ""Good. I like modest people. Especially, if they are smart and funny.""
Me:  ""Were those compliments in disguise?""

She: ""Why do you need to convert my generalizations to attributions ?""
Me:  ""Don't know. Why do you need to play games?""

(She giggled again and made a deep eye contact.)

She : ""I don't remember the last time I laughed so much.""
Me:   ""Well, I hope you shall remember this time.""

(The power was back. The rain had also significantly receded.)

She:""Okay. Time to go.""

(We prepared to leave. I went to the shelf to collect my bag.)

She: ""Hey! You dropped your bookmark here.""
 
I went back to the table and picked up the bookmark. I looked around. She was gone. I couldn't understand. Why had she gone away so abruptly? There was no mention of whether we could meet again. Not even a proper goodbye. I became morose. 

I looked at the bookmark again.
There was something scribbled on it in a cute handwriting:

Edit: I am quoting a part of one of my favorite quotes from movie history,

In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.

As I am an engineering student, so I was in habit of sleeping late at nights. So, on that night, when I was going to sleep at 3 a.m., I heard sound of a dog howling . At first, I ignored that sound & pulled my quilt over my face to minimise the sound. But after some time it increased continuosly. In my state, the crying of dog is believed as a something of a bad prediction, so with great courage in that cold night, I removed my quilt to chase her away. When I opened my door, I saw the dog was running from one corner to the another corner of the hostel. As I got near to her, and tried she started howling more . I followed her and ended to a place where her pups were getting wet in the rain. I looked at them & then her, which was mother of those puppys, which were crying at that moment. I was just dumbstrucked, what to do now.
After that, I went to the store of the hostel and found some broken tables. I placed and arranged those tables in such a way for them, such that rain couldn't reach under the tables. But the floor was still wet. So, after that I came to my room & searched the clothes which I haven't worn for past months. Then I found one of my t-shirt, which I laid under the table so that they can feel warm. After that I gave some biscuits to that mother. She was so obliged for this, that she was trying to rub her head on my legs & started licking my hands, I think it was her way to express thanks.

Think about it for a second. ONE FAMILY, A BILLION USD. 

Now look at that ugly looking piece of junk once again. A billion dollars. Look outside any window from the building, and you can see abject poverty all around. And then you choose to make something for 1 BILLION USD, just for your own family. 

It's your money, and I know you have the right to spend it any way you want, Mr. Ambani. But at least design it to become a landmark- a thing of beauty and pride for the city (btw, Burj Al Arab also cost 1 billion USD to build, is a source of national pride, and brings in tourism and money for itself and for others as well), or just to look like an average office building, but at least not something that makes the whole area look poorer by addition of a billion dollars to it. 

If this is not bad freaking design, I don't know what is."

Ans. When my brother was about to born, the doctor asked Mom ""Is this your first baby?""
Mom- No, second.
Doctor - The first is a son or daughter.
Mom- Son.
Doctor - Same again. Congrats!
Mom- Didn't respond but shed a tear silently.
Doctor - What happened?
Dad- Actually, she wanted to have a daughter this time.
Doctor - I have never seen someone crying on knowing that they will be blessed with a son.
After two years, when my sister was born, my family was overjoyed.
Mom says that girls complete a family. Boys and girls are both equally important. So true!
As a kid, I envied my sister as she was pampered the most. Today, she left for college after her vacation and I have time to sit and reflect on how much we love her. She is youngest in the family and is the apple of everyone's eye. She is our angel, our lucky charm.
Girls are expressive. She credited me and my brother for her success but I failed to tell her that my thought process is a gift of having an amazing sister. I respect stranger girls as I also expect others to respect my princess.
I don't find the stereotypical jokes on women with the message ""Women are dumb"" funny anymore.
The Crime against women would be history if people treat other girls the same way they want their sisters to be treated."

An excerpt from the book ""Wings of Fire"" by Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam:

""Towards the end of my visit at NASA, I went to the Wallops Flights Facility at Wallops Island in East coast, Virginia. This place was the base for NASA's sounding rocket programme. Here I saw a painting prominently displayed in the reception lobby. It depicted a battle scene with a few rockets flying in the background. A painting with this theme should be the most common place thing at a flight facility, but the painting caught my eye, because the soldiers on the side launching the rockets were not white but were dark skinned, with racial features found in South Asia. It turned out to be Tipu Sultans army fighting the British. The painting depicted a fact forgotten in Tipu's own country but commemorated here on the other side of the planet."""
703,"How can you live an interesting life?
.
.
.
.

Three tips that I've found helpful for leading a more interesting life:

1. Be willing to do things by yourself. A lot of people want to take art classes or try new restaurants or travel to exotic countries, but few people consider doing these things without companions. If you're not willing to do stuff by yourself, you end up missing out on a lot of interesting opportunities because there's no one around to join you.

2. Say ""yes"" to as many opportunities as possible. If someone asks you if you'd like to go to a new restaurant or volunteer for a charity or do a weekend road trip together, say ""yes"". The more things you try, the more interesting your life will be.

3. Stop caring about what is normal or expected. Sometimes the only thing stopping you from doing something cool is that you're afraid of looking stupid or weird. The problem is that many things seemed stupid or weird until they didn't: traveling for a year after college, dropping out of school to start a tech company, joining an online dating site, etc. It's hard to veer off the beaten path and have an exceptional life if you're always looking for social acceptance."

708,"Was Rahul Gandhi a good student at Harvard?
.
.
.
.

(Most Viewed Answer on Rahul Gandhi) 

Harvard has a policy called the 'Happy Bottom Quarter', indeed it was the pioneer of this policy- which was later adopted by a lot of other 'branded' schools- Yale, Princeton, Stanford etc. The college seeks to capture the highest number of potentially high impact, high celebrity individuals, not the best students per se- like say, Caltech or the IITs.

This is important to remember. 

Harvard is trying to maximize its prestige. 

What this policy means is that 25% of the students it admits are not there for academic reasons at all. They are there because they have the potential to be influential due to other factors, and can thus add to the college's prestige.

Now what builds a college's prestige? Successful alumni, of course- producing presidents, prime ministers and senior politicians, movie and sports stars, nobel prize winners, experts at the top of their field, millionaires and billionaires, entrepreneurs etc. 

Out of these- nobel prizes and experts get captured by fostering strong academic disciplines. Smart people who want money very badly manage to become millionaires with relatively high frequency, so that's covered too.

They can capture the entrepreneur market to some extent as well, because smart people tend to start the best companies these days, but entrepreneurship is unpredictable, no matter what you do, you can't ensure that the next Facebook comes from Harvard as well. 

Movie stars are also tricky. You can catch young actors, sure, but they are already earning a lot of money and their schedules don't give them time to go to college. Many of them decide not to.

Luckily that still leaves you with politicians, sports stars, and CEOs. 

Athletes at this stage are usually not at their peak physical condition compared to the pros, but you can still pick the most promising of the fresh crop and with reasonable accuracy they will end up winning medals once they get older and hit their prime.

Today's world is rife with nepotism - from democracies the US to India to Japan, to every despotic island you can think of- politicians and princes have done their best to keep their kids in power. The vast majority of Indian politicians are the children of politicians, and the Congress is notorious for being the most dynastic party of all. Rahul Gandhi's father, grandmother, and great grandfather were all prime ministers of India. His great-great grandfather was the leader of the Indian National Congress. 

It was the easiest choice in the world for Harvard to take him, for it was clear, by applying simple extrapolation, that he was probably going to end up as a politician, a career that, in India at least, has always emphasized and made virtues out of blood ties and dog-like loyalty rather than competence, critical thinking and/or intelligence. 

The same goes for sons of billionaires, especially those running family businesses disguised as MNCs, such as the ones we have in India. Admitting someone from these families is a great idea for a college - some day the business will pass into the hands of the son, and the college can claim another wealthy industrialist on its alumni roster. 

So it seems obvious that Rahul Gandhi was part of the Happy Bottom Quarter, but please note the second word of HBQ. 

The reason the happy quarter exists is so that they are satisfied merely by being in Harvard, and don't care about competing to get grades. It ensures that the 75% students admitted for their academic prowess will never end up in the bottom quarter, which could be dangerously detrimental to their feelings of self worth.

TL:DR We can be reasonably sure he was in the bottom 25%, at least at the time of admission.

Did he deserve to get a seat there?

If you believe that the Happy Bottom Quarter approach is a legitimate way for the school to pick its students- then yes, he certainly deserved the seat there. If you don't, then no. 

Did he have to make a huge donation to get into Harvard? Possibly- but probably not. He was big enough of a celebrity by virtue of genealogy to get in even without that.

Obviously Harvard is pretty happy with its investment. Trading 1 seat out of 2200 for an x% chance (where x>>0) of getting a prime minister on the alumni list seems like a good business transaction. If he becomes PM- 50 years later no one will remember that he was an utterly mediocre individual.

Crazy, amazing and true. It has passed around in all the IIT confession pages but cannot be exactly pointed out to one.

""Hi,
I'm a senior of yours, well super-super-super senior. Let me say when I joined there were only 7 IITs. We thought we were special, we thought we were kings of the world and everyone around us (friends, families) made us feel so as well. We thought after 4 years, we'd go storming through the gates at the world outside and bend things to our will.
But anyway 7 or so years later as I look around at my batchmates - and what have we accomplished? Some of us started working after our grad and are at various levels in their organisations - but so are a lot of our peers who did not go to IIT. Most of us went abroad for an MS/PhD. A lot of us have completed our PhD and now work in industry in the states with equally or smarter PhDs from Harvard, MIT, stanford.. you name it. Some of us went to IIMs and now are working with banks, start-ups etc. But then most of our batchmates at IIM did NOT go to IIT and here they are with equal or better jobs. We thought we'll crack GMAT and the US business schools would embrace us. Ok, 8.2 CG with a 770 GMAT with a 4 year IT experience in an I-bank? You have to compete with Ivy Leaguers, who interned on Wall Street and had a start-up and scored as much at GMAT with mind-blowing communication skills.
What is the point I am trying to make? Your time in IIT now is like those student football players in Friday Night Lights. You are considered and probably believe it too - that you are special. But tomorrow when you go out there, all of this will get wiped off and you will start off on a clean slate. Do not think you are kings of the world already because you are not. Frankly, what is your contribution to the world so far? Just clearing a very tough entrance exam? And the world should bow over for that? This spike in your status in your age-group is just that - a spike. A lot of you, in fact most of you will lead normal lives with no significant unique contribution to the world with your signature on it. A select few of you may, but others will lead lives no different than any your peers from lesser universities. You will make the same amount of money, have similar social status. Maybe once in a while when you say IIT you might get the odd look of respect. But to sustain it, it will have to be earned. In the real world."""

There’s a beautiful quote from the movie ‘Shall We Dance’ in which Susan Sarandon (the wife) tries to explain why people get married.

It simply says that we marry because we need a witness to our lives.

""We need a witness to our lives. There's a billion people on the planet... I mean, what does anyone's life really mean? But in a marriage, you're promising to care about everything -the good things, the bad things, the terrible things, the mundane things... all of it, all of the time, every day. 

You're saying 'Your life will not go unnoticed because I will notice it. Your life will not go un-witnessed because I will be your witness'.""

730,"Who is the best news presenter in India and Why?
.
.
.
.
.

There are lot of good news presenters in English news channels but for Hindi news there is a great dearth of good news presenters. Most of the news presenters in Hindi news channels go for sensational news and over hype each and every issue. The vocabulary used by them is replete with larger than life metaphors and idioms. Their expressions are aggressive and dramatic. 

Their programs are not very educative and they cater to only non-serious issues or peripheral domains of serious issues leading to the neglect of fields like economy and foreign relations in their coverage. For example if inflation is rising then instead of discussing its causes they will discuss how 'onions are making people cry'. It is probably assumed by them that non-English understanding population is incapable of appreciating intellectual discussions and all it wants is something sensational.

However one news presenter stands out among this lot and it is Ravish Kumar of NDTV India.

Ravish kumar uses a very simple language which can be understood by anyone but still he is able to convey his views on very complex topics in a lucid manner. His every show starts with nearly five minutes of monologue in which he tries to present various dimensions,views and nuances of the topic so that the viewers can have some understanding of the underlying problem. His expressions are calm but intense and his vocabulary is rich and elegant.

The major difference lies in the fact that Ravish Kumar gives adequate time to the panelists to make their points, while keeping them on the topic. He jumps in and agrees to the points made by panelists, and when they are going off-top he brings them back to the actual debate, without being rude. In the first half section he gives adequate time to the guests for their arguments.Ravish always keeps the debate to a very focussed point instead of bringing in everything related to that topic.

732,"Should I marry a man who is an MA and earns 1.4 lakhs per year when I'm earning 7 lakhs per year?
.
.
.
.
.

Please do not do it. And I have a very strong reason why. 

My parents had a love marriage, and my mother was very highly qualified. She actually finished her doctorate after she had her child, and at that time my father was working in a factory.

My father unconditionally supported my mom in her studies, career, and life. My mother finished her education in twice the time most people take, and now is in a slightly senior management position in a reputed firm. 

My father on the other hand grew only through hard work and hard work alone, and now is in the top management position also in a reputed firm and travels the world on a regular basis. And he's still not half as qualified as his wife. 

But my childhood was hell. My mother is a borderline abusive woman, and was always belittling my dad for being lesser qualified. She showed him no respect, and if he said anything back, all he would hear was that he had no right to say anything because he was uneducated, and earned lesser than her. Even when her anger turned towards me and my dad would try to defend me, the same thing would happen. 

They somehow worked things out and are still together, although I don't understand their dynamics as I moved out as soon as I could. 

But the bottom line, if you're counting pennies before you are married, your bottled up feelings will surface somewhere, sometime. At that time, it will be hell for your kid. 

For the sake of your future children, please, please marry a man you can completely respect, and not just because of how much he earns.

Very interesting deadlock.
Many years ago, a Law teacher came across a student who was willing to learn but was unable to pay the fees. The student struck a deal saying, ""I will pay your fee the day I win my first case in the court"".
Teacher agreed and proceeded with the law course. When the course was finished and teacher started pestering the student to pay up the fee, the student reminded him of the deal and pushed days.
Fed up with this, the teacher decided to sue the student in the court of law and both of them decided to argue for themselves.
The teacher put forward his argument saying:
""If I win this case, as per the court of law, the student has to pay me as the case is about his non-payment of dues.
And if I lose the case, the student will still pay me because he would have won his first case...
So either way I will get the money"".
Equally brilliant, the student argued back saying:
""If I win the case, as per the court of law, I don't have to pay anything to the teacher as the case is about my non-payment of dues.
And if I lose the case, I don't have to pay him because I haven't won my first case yet....
So either way, I am not going to pay the teacher anything"".
This is one of the greatest paradoxes ever recorded.
Who is right and who is the winner?
This is part of ancient Greek history. The lawyer teacher was Protagoras (c.485-415 BCE) and the student was Euthalos. This is known as Protagoras's Paradox. This case was not solved. The most interesting part - this is still debated (even today) in law schools as a logic problem..."

737,"Q: What is the best advice a senior gave you at IIM?
.
.
.
.
.
.

Advice is something that you get freely all throughout your life, and IIM was no different.. The best piece of advice I got from a senior(or a super tuchcha) came from a certain Harsha Bhogle.. He was in Ahmedabad for the Test Match between India and as he loves to visit the campus from time to time, he had come over a quick chat with the ones on campus. He was talking to us about life, and one thing stood out in his conversation.. He said and I quote ' The biggest trap that you can fall into is if you can be successful without giving your 100 percent in whatever you are doing. Consider a player of the stature of Rahul Dravid. If he is playing against an Ahmedabad XI week in week out, he will score a century in each and every one of the matches by just giving 60% of what he normally does in an International match. If he continues to get centuries by just performing at 60% of his ability, week in week out, he will never be able to perform at his best when he really wants to. Be very wary of complacency. All of us have been toppers in our lives, and that is why we are here, but once you are out of this place, and if success comes to you easily, be very careful. It's treacherous path to tread down'.

739,"Why is stealing money wrong?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

In the United States, my home country, the average life expectancy is 78.4 years. The median age of graduation from a university, a requisite for most career paths, is now 27. It takes about 5 years to establish oneself and begin earning a respectable living after college. Most Americans expect to retire at 66.

This means I have 34 years to earn money, but it takes an average of 18 years to pay off my student loans - so 13 of my 34 prime earning years. That gives me 21 years of real earnings, assuming I'm not spending a large amount of capital on my children. The slightest deviation from the mean and that number is suddenly in the teens.

There are so many things in life that we never experience because of this wage structure. We never visit places we dreamed of as kids, we miss our children's milestones, and we miss decades of our parents wisdom because we were working through their twilight years. A career, though necessary, already takes so much LIFE from us.

That small, prescious amount of life we have left over, particularly when we are young and vibrant, is represented by our tangible assets. That is to say by money, or the things it might purchase.

When you steal from another person, you think you are taking money. What you are actually stealing is that person's life. Thousands of heartbeats, days of work that we wish we had the ability to spend on something meaningful; spent with the hope of earning enough to make our free time more worthwhile.

When you steal money, you kill a part of that person. Because their time on this Earth is finite, you literally rip away part of their life force and transfer it to yourself. 

That is why it is a crime, and wrong.

740,"Q:  My dog died, I got fired, and my best friend told me he just saw my girlfriend with another guy. How can I find happiness?

You are a very lucky man. You have just gotten rid of a woman that valued money and success more than she valued love. She's left you for a richer man. Sometimes we become attached to people who are not attached to us. Since we are not capable of leaving them, we grow dependent on them, following their whims to keep them, it is a very big strike of luck that she left you instead of making you lose more and more time in life. Now you are free to pursue another love.

You are a very lucky man, indeed. You have been fired from a job you wouldn't have quit because you thought it was good, but it was actually preying on you. Your boss was taking your girlfriend! What else could he take from you? He was taking time, taking your workforce, using you to get the money which he was using to lure your woman away from you. It's indeed a very great strike of luck that you have parted ways with such a noxious person.

In both cases, you have no regrets. Your former lover cannot blame you for leaving her. Your former boss can't complain you left the job without finishing or that you crossed him. You are free.

But, man, you have lost a dog. What an invaluable gift of God! I just hope it wasn't either your boss or your lover that killed it! That would have been too cruel. Anyway, dogs live short lives. Their death are a foreboding display of your own future. 

Live each day as the last. One day it will be.

You can't replace the dog, of course, no other dog will be like him.

You can't replace the girlfriend, which is good: you don't want another one like her.

You can't replace your boss, which is good too: you don't want another such snake around you.

Life can't be worse. You have experience one of the worst humiliations a man can endure. Which means the path ahead will be softer.

I won't wish you good luck. You have it already. I wish you patience to wait. Some people get so used to their luck that they can't wait long enough. They eat their meals raw, and they settle for the next opportunity, instead of the best.

743,"Ques:How have you started a conversation with a stranger of opposite gender while travelling?

Ans.Well I started a conversation with a stranger of opposite sex while I was travelling to Chennai from Mumbai for official work but the guy took a troll on me!
so the story goes like this.....
This happened couple of months back, when I was travelling from Mumbai to Chennai for a board meeting.
I gave a sigh of relief, as soon as I entered the AC coach of my train. One minute late and the train would have left......Well, the contentment of getting into the train was intensified as I saw an extremely good looking and well groomed boy of my age in the same compartment. My heart skipped a beat.... If looks could kill then it was his.!!!!
After keeping my luggage I tried to be comfortable but the naughty me was thinking of talking to that handsome young man. With a I have cool attitude accent, I asked him, Hello! I like the book you are reading.He gave no sign of being interested.I thought maybe he is too engrossed in reading, let me try once again. But there was no reply this time too. Then he looked up and gave me a blank look. I thought, What crap!! leave. I don't care if he doesn't talk.''
I took up my book and started reading it.Within a minute I saw a piece of paper being pushed towards me. I lifted up my gaze to see the boy giving me a chit. I took the chit that read, '' I see that you are trying to talk to me, but I am deaf and dumb. if you don't mind can we communicate via this chit.'' I was astounded....such a handsome boy .... deaf and dumb... why god is so brutal... why this injustice?? My eyes were turning misty but I controlled myself and wrote something on the chit to make him comfortable. He told me he would be getting down one station after mine. The rest one hour he asked me silly questions like what would you do if you had to jump in a well or fire?'' I replied I would rather jump in water. There may be chances of survival. Then he asked me '' What came before chicken or egg?'' I patiently replied to all his stupid questions thinking his thinking process was also probably impaired. But those innocent looks left an undeniable mark on my heart.
As the train approached my station, I got up to get down, he handed me over a chit and pleaded that I read the chit after getting down. I bid adieu to the boy with a thousand unanswered questions.
The first thing I did, after getting down was to open the chit. It read,''I am sorry to say that I am neither deaf nor dumb I am doing a course on PSYCHIATRY, and wanted to have some practical experience. you have proved to be a excellent specimen to how a man reacts when faced with unusual situations.'' And his P.S. read''I must also add that I am a graphologist and you need to improve your handwriting.''
My mouth was open for at least 2 minutes. I don't know for how much time I stood on the platform speechless, but I could distinctly hear my heart shattering into million pieces on a concrete platform. ;)"
744,"Ques:What should a person choose between love or career?

Ans.True story.
A woman who was reporting to me came into my office to ask for help.
""Dushka"" she says. ""There is an opening for someone with my qualifications in our office in China. Can you please help support my transfer?""
Me: ""I'd support anything you were really interested in. Would your husband go with you?""
Her: ""No. He's working for a start-up and feels it's important to stay"".
Me: ""But, you've been married less than two months. Please give this some thought. It's a really tough thing to do to a relationship. Listen: good jobs come and go. Finding a husband is a once in a life time thing (ideally.)""
Her: ""We've talked about it, and we really want to do this"".
So, against my better judgement, I help her transfer. Inwardly, I know they are making a really big mistake.
Time goes by. I see their posts on Facebook. They are having a candle-lit dinner together via Skype. They are in opposite ends of the world, and every few months meet in a new ""midway"" location so they are traveling a lot. They look so happy. She tells me they are in touch multiple times a day.
Then she calls to tell me her year is up, that she's ready to return. She says she learned so much, and got to visit many places she had always dreamed of. The fact that her experience is now more international is a huge asset to my team.
I find out through reading the news that his very successful start up sold for millions and millions of dollars.
How is that for giving someone the wrong advice?
Sometimes you feel you have a choice to make between two opposite things and the truth is that is rarely the case. Choose to have it all, and then make intelligent decisions to make it viable.

745,"Ques:What are some short stories about father?

Ans.Background: I am CA (Chartered Accountant) from a family of Doctors and Engineers.
10 YEARS AGO:
When I had cleared 10th standard and had to pick a stream for my +2. I wanted to choose commerce as I was pretty clear that CA would be my career choice.
However my Dad completely overruled me and ""decided"" (for me) that it had to be Engineering stream till +2, after that I could decide on my own whether to become a CA or an Engineer. And annoyingly, he had also convinced the owner of my city's best and biggest CA preparation institute (who was like family) to take his side.
Virtually left with no option, I took the Engineering stream for those two years, attended classes for IIT-JEE. But since I wasn't really interested in it...I never feared the exam.
FAST FORWARD 2 YEARS:
I cleared IIT-JEE, although with a poor rank but still had an option to take a college...I had half a mind to pick one as I didn't want two years of life to end up being ""wasted"" away. During counselling, (the process of picking up a college and branch), sitting with my Dad, I had picked up Mechanical Engineering (it appealed to me the most!) from NIT Durgapur...And about 45 seconds later, I turned to him and said...
""Nah...I'll pursue CA only!""
Do note that he didn't object or react even once during the entire scenario.
Next day I was sitting in room with 400 others taking lessons for CA CPT(the first exam).
FAST FORWARD 4 YEARS 6 MONTHS:
I had cleared CA final and CAT together, was a national ranker in CA level 2...
And that's when I had the talk...
Me: Dad, I never told you...But I am really grateful that you forced me into Engineering that day...
He seemed touched and asked my why?
Me: Well not only were the Math skills of those days helpful in both CA and CAT...But the kind of thrill from competition, I experienced (even though unwillingly) during IIT-JEE preparation is something I never experienced in CA...in a way those 2 years were an ideal (although unconventional) platform to go into the CA field.
Dad: You know what was my concern when you wanted to choose Commerce that day?
Me: What?
Dad: In a small city like ours, where commerce students don't have a college like an SRCC or Hindu to inspire them, they often lose the determination to study hard and build a career...I never doubted your ability...I was only worried about whether you were determined enough to pursue a field no one in our family had pursued before...
When on the counselling day, you told me that you still wanted to pursue CA, I was convinced that you'd do it.
If the expression, on his face that day, is the last thing I see before I die, I'll die happy!
Moral: Listening to your parents' advice (orders) may not sound cool...But is the coolest way to live!"

In the legal course we had in business school, the law professor would say - ""It is my job to be the no man and your job to be the yes man"". A leader by nature is an optimist. He sees a rosy path. His counsel by nature should be a pessimist. He should point to the thorns. 

The reason why we have two different roles - RBI governor and Finance Minister - to manage the economy is essentially along the lines. Like yin and yang, tester and developer, they complement each other. 

RBI governors like all bankers and lawyers are selected to be very conservative. They have to look for the worst case. When the bankers party, things collapse like it happened in 2008. 

On the other hand, an executive cannot be that sullen and pessimistic. That would break the system as the gloominess would catch on. He/she has to be the chief cheerleader to get the system going. They have to find a smile even when the situation is deadly. Because, they are the morale boosters. We have already seen the effects of having a sullen economist as a Prime Minister for 10 years. While he was smart about economics, he was not able to cheer or guide the economy. 

You don't want an economist to lead the country nor a politician to govern the RBI. When Raghuram Rajan is pessimistic and Narendra Modi is optimistic, it means both of them are doing their jobs. They differ because one is looking at the worst case and the other at the best case.

751,"What are some of the best (or worst) instances of sledging in cricket?

I don't know whether this counts or not. This is not on field but off field sledging by none other than Rahul Dravid..

The conversation started with the southpaw stating that he played a big part as a bowler in India’s series win in England in 2007 under the captaincy of Dravid, which led to a comparison of Sachin Tendulkar and Ganguly’s bowling statistics from the 2007 series showing up on the screen.
Here are the excerpts:

Dravid: I was just trying to figure out how many overs I gave to Tendulkar and Ganguly (in 2007). Maybe I under bowled Ganguly there, but Sachin had more Test wickets.
Ganguly: He (Dravid) always did that.
Bhogle: Tendulkar has more Test wickets than Ganguly.
Ganguly: That’s because he (Tendulkar) bowled half his overs on turning pitches in India. 
Bhogle: I like how you (Ganguly) are sticking to your territory.
Ganguly: Those turning pitches on day 5 in India. Those dust bowls. I wish I knew how to bowl a little bit of spin. That’s on flat batting pitches. On good pitches where you needed skill, look at the economy (2.3 rpo in 2007). I did the perfect 5th bowler’s job.

Dravid: Sanjay Manjekar made a really good point in the commentary box. If Ganguly had been a yard quicker and just a little bit fitter, he would have been a match-winner. 

Ganguly: I wish I was Prime Minister of India. I could have done a whole lot of things.
Bhogle: I almost feel like not getting into this conversation. I’m getting away, this is some serious sledging. Come on Rahul, don’t be a good boy here.
Ganguly: Ask Rahul Dravid. When he won the toss at Trent Bridge in 2007 in our famous Test series win, England were going at almost 6 an over who did he fall back to?
Dravid: I’m not denying that. I’m absolutely not denying that. I just made the point that if Ganguly didn’t get tired after 5-6 overs, I would have bowled him much longer spells.
Ganguly: I would request the production team to get the spell out and we need a judgement here.
Dravid: Don’t forget the speeds as well.
Ganguly: I bowled 10 overs on the trot for 1/15. I’ve seen biased people, but I’ve not seen as much.
Bhogle: One thing you got to admit Rahul, he (Ganguly) does know his numbers.
Dravid: I’ve never doubted that. His numbers and the numbers of any left-handed batsman in the world, Sourav knows.
Ganguly: He (Dravid) must have been happy that he had a player with intensity in his team. A player who cared for the numbers and the game. That’s what you look for as a captain.
Bhogle: I think there’s a reason he (Dravid) under bowled you (Ganguly). As a captain, you made him keep wickets.
Dravid: No Bhogle, don’t needle.
Ganguly: He (Dravid) did a job for the team and I desperately needed him to do that. We became a better team after that.

Post:- 

I always wanted to write this answer but I will write this as an anonymous.

I met her on 5th April 2006. That was my first day in the new school. While standing on the railing I saw her for the first time and I thought how cute she was (I was in 8th standard). Luckily after 5 minutes she entered the same class where my bag was and we became classmates. I liked her the moment I saw her first because her smile was adorable with her ponies bouncing. Time passed and we became good friends. She was very beautiful. Whole of our school was mad for her and she was so charming that even the school teachers use to like her a lot. I was an ugly looking and average intelligence guy. I used to feel nervous whenever I tried to talk to her. A lot of my friends used to tell me how they loved her and I used to keep listening to them with the feeling of killing them with HULK SMASH. I did stupid things at that time like, I used to buy the same pen she used to write with, I used to roam around on my cycle at the time she used to go out for a walk with her elder sister (my hit rate would be 1 out of 10 times) and used to convince myself that I am not falling in for her. Time passed and I grew fond of her but with time differences crept in our friendship. 

We grew apart and in 11th grade she got a different section than mine. I could not bear it. She was friends with the smartest and ""coolest"" guys with the school and me being under confident stopped talking to her. I used to roam around for hours listening to Atif Aslam's ""Aadat"". That time I realized that I loved her and I was mad for her. I was screwing my life and just to get away from her so that I do not see her face, I went to Kota in 12th. I was diagnosed with Migraine and other issues because I used to keep thinking about her. Some how I convinced myself that if I study and clear JEE, I might become worthy in her eyes and we might have a future as I had heard that students from IITs do big things. With preparation of 8 months I gave JEE and cracked it. After giving my exam I  realized that I had to work on my physique. I lost 25Kgs in 4 months break which we get after giving JEE. Still our talks became shorter and we use to talk like once in a week or 2 weeks. Before going to college I wrote her a letter about all the things we shared in the past 5 years (8th to 12th). It took me 3 days to write a draft of that letter. I cried writing that letter and some how was able to send her. I never expected to get anything out from that but I wanted her to know. 

Then in 2010 I joined my college. She called me after 3 weeks of delivery of that letter. We talked for sometime. I inquired whether she was committed or not. She said ""no"". My friends back home told me that she was committed and I did not believe them because I thought she won't lie to me. I proposed her on 20th October at 10.28PM (co incidentally her birthday also falls on Oct 28th )after mustering courage and she rejected. That one minute was one of the longest one minutes of my life till now. 

I could not stop thinking about her but somehow I managed to sail through that first year without talking to her then one day in my 2nd year I wrote her a 2500 words letter of which I did not expect any reply. I use to dream about her a lot. Once, I had a dream of travelling with her till eternity on my scooter and she holding my shoulder with her hands.  Time passed and by the end of my 4th year I realized I was still unconditionally in love with her. I did not know much about her after we separated in 11th but I still continued to love her. I must have deleted her number a thousand times so that I could not message her but I remembered her number. Every time I used to try to make myself believe that I did not know her number and every time her number use to come in front of my eyes but I never called her because she was very happy in her life (my friends told me). I did not want to be the reason of her worries.

I came to Bangalore to work and she went in some other city. I could not keep her out of my mind. One of my college friend came to work here and whenever we use to drink OLD MONK, her thoughts used to make me happy. Recently I met her in Bangalore. She called me when she came here and we spent 2 hours together and I again fell in love with her. I did not save her new number because I knew that only pain awaits on that path. I was shocked and happy to realize that I remembered every single detail about her since I first met her.I could not tell her that I still loved her, her thoughts, her big samosa nose, her small eyes and her face when she gets irritated. I slept very well that day. A month passed and I decided that it was time to move on and I went out with a girl. We had fun but I realized even after 9 years I  wanted to go out on a date with just one girl. I got irritated and behaved badly with my date for which I still feel bad. 

Today I had a thought of her getting married with some other person. It broke me down. A tear rolled down my eyes but it gave me satisfaction to know that  she had learnt how to live her life happily. 

She is still a distant dream which I chase unconsciously in my mind because she was all I ever wanted..
It was long story but I am glad that you read.

EDIT - Actually I did not propose her I just said to her that ""I Love Her"" not ""I  Like Her"". I wanted to be specific to her (Childish I know). I am clarifying this because I read that proposal is for marriage but I never did that :P

Comment:- 

Dear Anonymous,

You are suffering from Oneitis. Seriously, look it up. You're not alone. Heck, we've all been there, but we snap out of it in time. You've been down this path for too many years brother. Time to change that.

When a man goes down a path for far too long, he forgets the reason he embarked on that path.

As I've found out myself, there's no sure fire way of curing oneitis. We all deal with it in our own way and eventually get over it.

Go somewhere where you can get some privacy. Close your eyes. Look inside yourself and imagine the day you will die. None of this will ever matter. Imagine if you reach that day with a ton of regrets weighing you down. Was that girl really worth wasting your life over? Can you imagine how much of life you missed out because of someone else? How much you never saw, never felt? You'll be dying alone. Now imagine her, embracing her life and death with her family and loved ones. With her partner. Probably smiling her way into oblivion while you struggle for one last gulp of breath, because oh... you missed so much and want to get another chance. But it's too late.

Awake. Scared? Good. Now snap out of it. You're alive. You've got today. You're a living embodiment of the universe's mystery. Did you know that you're made of stellar material which reach earth after billions of years out in the Cosmos? Brother, YOU are the universe!  
 
Go out today. Smile. It'll be hard at first, but you'll fake it till you make it. Go out with friends. Laugh. Get drunk, get high if that's your thing. Make eye contact with that cutie in the coffee shop. You're a handsome fella, see how many girls are eyeing you? 
Enjoy the exuberance of youth! 

You've got ONE life. An empty mind is the devil's workplace. DO what you have to do to keep your mind engaged. Don't let even a minute of your life go to waste. Help OTHERS! Volunteer, teach, read, go to old age homes, travel - give your time to those who appreciate it, and those who have no one else. Carpe Diem.

And remember: She lost someone who would have killed for her, died for her. And you lost NO ONE, because she never even acknowledged your existence. She lost everything and you lost NOTHING.

I wouldn't have written so much if I didn't know what you're thinking. Trust me, I do. I've been there. And I recovered. A brand new me, with a drive that's bereft of any external motivation. It's me who drives me.I got tired of giving my remote control to others anymore. You'll do the same. And someday you'll find someone who appreciates you for who YOU are. Who'll be drawn by your craziness. And for her, you'll never have to change or get better. Because, for her, you'll always be whole, not half.

755,"In my time at IIT Kgp, the attendance in any course was directly proportional to the strictness of the professor about attendance. In my 2nd year a course started and in the beginning the Prof seemed to be pretty chilled out about attendance. So, I took advantage of that and bunked a lot of classes.

After the midsems (which also happened to be 1st class after DP holidays), I decided to turn up for the class. And within a few minutes I realized that during my hiatus, the Prof had a drastic transformation and seemed more like his evil twin from a parallel universe.

At the end of the class he started calling out attendance and reprimanded anyone who had been absent for more than 2-3 classes. He would call a person's roll no. and ask him why he was absent for so many classes. The best excuse the guys could come up with was, health problems and the Prof told them to bring a note from the doctor to prove it, otherwise he would deregister them from the course. By this time I was shitting my pants off, as I had been absent for at least 10-11 classes. Anyway I waited for my roll no. to come up.

The Prof called my roll no. and went through the register  counting my no. of days of missing the class. I waited with bated breath, and he finally raised his head. He somehow knew who I was, and looked directly at me. Our eyes met  and we kept looking at each other for a few seconds ( He with an intimidating expression and me with a poker face). And suddenly, I don't know what happened to me, I broke into a sweet smile. The Prof kept staring for a second more and then he also smiled back.

He then went back into his register and called out the next roll no, who happened to be my best friend and partner in crime, having a similar attendance record. My friend stood up and seemed to be so scared that he wasn't even able to speak out any excuse. The Prof watched him for a few seconds and then said, "" Do you have any good excuse or at least a great smile like your friend?"" And the friend also broke into a wide smile."

765,"A great example of Coincidence
.
.

.
.
.
.

I got admission in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2006 and soon enough after the result, I got the whole timeline from them, including what dorm (or hostel) I was assigned and when I could get in.

My parents and I thought a good idea to go a week before the classes start at it would give me a good buffer time. More than that, we also thought getting this early will also save us time and hassle. So the idea was to come across as few people as possible in this whole process, so every thing would be smoother.

The letter from IIT told us that there would be IIT buses commuting between the campus and the New Delhi train station every hour for admission days and we could ride it.

So, I reached at the New Delhi station and got on the bus with my dad. The bus was less than 10% occupied when it was about to leave the station for the campus. I was not very social, so I went to the side where there were no people. Just before the bus started, another guy (his name was Anuraj Gupta) came with his father and sat on the same seat where I was. I could overhear the two of them a few times and apparently he seemed very ""people"" type person, he didn't poke me though.

So we got off the bus in front of my dorm, and guess what, this Anuraj guy was also in the same dorm, and while we were walking to there, he asked me, ""Where are you from?"", and the whole conversation for that day was this (This conversation was in Hindi, but English translation goes like this):

Anuraj (A2): Where are you from?
Ashish (Me, A1): Kanpur.
A2: Oh me too! Not really expected anyone from Kanpur to come to IIT Delhi. (They mostly chose IIT Kanpur campus)

A1: What department?
A2: Chemical Engineering. You?
A1: Me too! Same city, same department, same dorm, not bad.

A2: Haha. Where did you get your 12th from?
A1: Deen Dayal, it's in Nawabganj, if you have heard.
A2: Have I heard? I have had my 12th from Deen Dayal!

And as the conversation went on, it turned out he lived hardly 2 miles from my home! And then we were talking more:

A2: Were you in Deen Dayal from 6th grade to 12th then? I came in 9th.
A1: Yes, I got in in 6th grade. Where were you before 9th?
A2: I was in Nav Saraswati School. It's in Govind Nagar.
A1: You are kidding!! I was in that Nav Saraswati school till 5th grade!

And our fathers were just amused how we had almost every detail in common. And just out of curiosity, his father suddenly happened to ask (me), ""Do you know what room you are?""
Each of us thought the question was to him, and we said in unison, ""NB-8."" and he just laughed.

So about an hour before, I had no idea who this guy was, and turned out we went to the same primary school, same middle school, same highschool, same college, same department, lived in the same dorm, and lived in the same dorm room for next two years.
(And not to forget, took the same train that day, stepped on the campus the same day and took the same bus, on a day I had expected the least number of people on my way).

A. God, Sex, and Being Good

Father: God arranged it that way.

Son: If I sit next to a girl I like will God arrange for that girl to have 
 my baby?

Father: No. You'll have to have sex to make a baby when you are 
 married. It's a sin to have sex before marriage.

Son: But aunty June isn't married and she's going to have a baby. Is she
 going to hell? I love aunty June! I don't want her to go to hell! 

Father: No, she's not going to hell. Jesus died for her sin. Remember 
 the picture of Jesus dying on the cross? He died for all our sins. 

Son: I don't get it. Jesus died a long time ago. How did Jesus know 
 aunty June was going to be a sinner?

Father: Jesus loved us so much he died for everybody's sins even the 
 sins of people who weren't born yet when he died. So, Sammy, 
 be good so Jesus would not have died in vain. Be good.

Son: Something's fishy. Jesus may have had good intentions but he 
 certainly wasn't very bright. He should have just asked God to arrange

770,"Q: Which things changes an patriotic IAS officer into corrupted one?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

99 out of 100 officers - begin their careers to serve the country. They have complete disdain for dishonesty. They believe they know solutions to the ills faced by the country. They think that the administrators before them had been somehow handicapped or inept to solve those issues and that, now things had changed.

However, when they enter into the service and get posted in a remote rural town as sub-divisional magistrate, they are suddenly faced with the grim realities of the society. They suddenly see reason in the way people behave. They understand why people, politicians, bosses and subordinates behave in the manner they do. 

They see why a clerk who is paid Rs 6000 as monthly salary, would mistreat a poor applicant and expect a bribe. They see why that poor applicant, who probably can not afford the bribe, approaches a local politician to get his work done. They see how that clerk would then do his work because of the threat posed by knowledge the politician has of his past corrupt behavior. They see how the clerk would anything for the local news stringer who also knows about all the shady transactions of the clerk. The officer sees why nobody wants to get the clerk removed from the post because people do not want to threaten the bread and butter of his family and they find a workaround: sharing the bounty and sparing the powerful/extremely poor. Everybody is happy. 

Except probably for the officer - who wants the clerk to go for misuse of authority. The officer wants to go against the societal norms of compassion for the members of the society because she wants to 'improve' the system. However, she finds it difficult to dislodge this person with connections to her bosses, local MA/MPs, police and media. 

She probably has hundreds of other such clerks to deal with, apart from truckloads of other files to dispose, events to organise and meetings to attend. For the officer, it becomes a very low priority issue, simply because she has no time to fight this nexus, even if she is willing and capable.

Then after a while when such issues pile up, the officer thinks, the problem would probably go away when the Government decides to hike the salary of the clerk. And the drive to 'cleanse' the system goes away.

Since, all this seems logical, their motivation to change it gradually wanes. 

As soon as this drive goes away, what choice does the officer think she has?

The officer finds out that she alone can not make a system level impact. She can either be an outlier at a small level, disliked by politicians, bosses and media or she can take the other route. 

And let me tell you, the only way you do not become a part of the problem is to not make any friends. This is probably the most difficult part for most officers: to suppress their urge to be social and to deal with the fact that you are the most disliked person in 2,000 square kilometers of area and even beyond. 

Nexus of Good: Did I hear you say that the public would support you? Practically, no. One, they are completely unaware of what really is going on. Two, we need a charismatic person to galvanise/streamline people  against local politicians/bureaucrats/media to lend their support to a just cause and to make this support somewhat effective. You can not find such charisma all too often and it is extremely hard to stand a chance against the might of the government. NGOs, activists, other good men? One, they are not super-active at lower levels. Two, many of these are also stakeholders in this abuse. Basically, it is far easier to find the other kind.  

Other route: With time, officer realises she can be part of a politician-bureaucracy-media-police-corporate nexus which abuses public resources and authority at a much larger scale. Many of us, decide to take the plunge and leave the 'cleansing' of the system to the government or time. 

PS: Do not lose hope. :) This was merely a hypothetical test case scenario. Their are many of us who take it as a personal challenge to straighten such people. We employ methods including but not limited to - use of decoy applicants, ACB traps, pep talks, threats of transfers/disciplinary action, etc. 

However, I seem to have found that the most effective weapon in your armour is the strength of your moral conviction. Nobody - absolutely nobody - dares stand in the way of a genuinely honest officer. They shiver at the thought of being hounded by such a guy. It usually works.

.
.
.
.
.
.

There's a college in the kolkata, India, called Heritage institute of technology. I read the following confession on there 'confessions page' on Facebook.

Here it goes :-
""
I see a lot of my juniors confessing about love , sex , makeouts, awesome college life, etc. I want to confess something else.

1. I joined Heritage in its early batches . I was quite introvert and was ragged a hell lot. A belt was tied around neck I was made to roam around the college on my first day. When I complained to my dad he thrashed me saying that I was a loser and wasting his hard earned money (he hoped that I was in IIT). I felt liked being raped that day; not by my college seniors but by my dad.

2. I got a very low grade in my first semester because i was pressurised by my dad to appear for IIT again. I got a severe thrashing from him again however, fortunately, my mom somehow rescued me.

3. In second semester I mustered up enough courage to propose to my best friend but she rejected me because in her words - ""She didn't wanted to be ridiculed by her friends"". She stopped talking to me since then. I was heartbroken as she and my mom were the only people I shared everything with.

4. During the 4th semester break, while I was returning home after teaching a student, I got a phone call informing me that my mom had expired. My world came crashing down that day. I cried for days; yet somehow managed to pick myself up as I had no other alternative. Life goes on.

5. My attendance fell very low that semester and I was summoned by the principal. When I told him about my mothers death he replied -""I hear this lie everyday. Please bring me your mother's the death certificate, if you even have one"". Then again while I was leaving he said - ""No need to bring death certificate, useless guys like you can even fake that. Call your dad"".

6. My friends always ridiculed me because I was loser. I didn't laugh at their jokes. To mix with them I started drinking. I didn't like the taste but I liked the high. I often used to act drunk to appear more cool. I learned to call girls ""magi"" but never knew its real meaning. That helped me survive college somehow.

7. It was the campus placements day. I got rejected that day again. Hoped to make it to the next company. But was unsuccessful till the end of the placement season. I tried a lot. Attended English speaking classes (my English was horrible; probably still is), bought a new pair of shirts. When my dad heard this he told me not to call again and this time I didn't feel remorse or regret for him. For the entire night I contemplated about suicide but couldn't as I had promised my mom that I will shine one day.

8. I started doing private tutions and preparing for CAT. I gave my everything. I got 99.87 percentile but couldn't make it again to any big IIM because of my low grades. What had I done now to deserve this? But fortunately, I finally got admitted into decent college and a helpful bank manger arranged for loan.

9. After passing out I got into Volvo-Eicher as a junior manager. I didn't last for 3 months because I couldn't lick my boss's boots properly. My service was terminated because of being inefficient.

10. I started making iphone apps in my leisure time while I was applying to a few companies. Slowly I took it up as a more serious start up. Got hold of 2 more friends like me who were from Computer Science background and were unable to find a job.

11. In 2011, I made a small office. By the end of 2011 I had a small group of 8 engineers working with me. In 2012, we bagged several contracts from companies like mobiquity, exxon mobile and the workforce increased to 80 developers. In march 2013 I will be applying for turnover of over 5 crores.
I don't know how to thank god for his blessings. I thank that senior who ragged me on my first day at college, that girl who dumped me, my professors who ridiculed me, the numerous friends who thought that I was a loser. It were these people who gave me the courage, the fire, the anger to succeed against all odds. Seriously no hard feelings guys. You made me what I am. I don't stay with my dad but I send him enough so that he can lead a comfortable life. My advise to all juniors- Shine in life. When a loser like me can, why cant you? Never let people say that you can't do it. Many people might have faced similar or more depressing situations in college life but NEVER EVER gave up. Let not a broken relationship, failed grade, lost job opportunity or your status among friends define you. And never lose faith in humanity; in goodness. There might be a few bad people, but there are a lot more good people around here. I met a lot of good people, professors in my college and believe me Heritage taught me a lot.
Lastly,
Mom, I hope you could read this. I love you a lot.

777,"What is the life of a samosa seller in India?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

True conversation:-

MUMBAI : I boarded the 18:50 train from Church Gate.
When the train was about to leave Marine lines,
A samosa vendor with an empty basket got on and took
the seat next to me.
As the compartment was sparsely occupied and my
destination was still far away,
I got into a conversation with him.
Me: ""Seems like you've sold all your samosas today.""
Vendor (smiling): ""Yes. By God's grace, full sales today.""
Me: ""I really feel sorry for you people. Don't you get tired doing
This tiresome job the whole day?""
Vendor: ""What to do, sir? Only by selling samosas like this every day do
We get a commission of 75 paise for each samosa that we sell.""
Me: ""Oh, is that so ? How many samosas do you sell on an average each day?""
Vendor: ""On peak days, we sell 4,000 to 5,000 samosas per day.
On an average, we sell about 3,000 samosas a day.""
I was speechless.....for a few seconds.......
The guy says he sells 3,000 samosas a day; at 75 paise each,
He makes about 2,000 rupees daily, or 60,000 rupees a month.
That's Rs. 60,000 a month. OMG.
I intensified my questioning and this time it was not for time pass.
Me: ""Do you make the samosas yourself?""
Vendor: ""No Sir. we gets the samosas through a samosa manufacturer
And we just sell them. After selling we give him the money
And gives us 75 paise for each samosa that we sell.""
I was unable to speak a single word more but the vendor continued...
""But one thing...most of our earnings are spent on living expenses.
Only with the remaining money are we able to take care of other business.""
Me: ""Other business? What is that?""
Vendor: ""It is a land business. In 2007 I bought 1.5 acres in
Palghar for 10 lakh rupees and I sold it a few months back for 60 lakhs.
Now I have bought land in umroli for 20 lakh rupees.""
Me: ""What did you do with the remaining amount?
Vendor: ""Of the remaining amount,
I have set aside 20 lakhs for my daughter's wedding.
I have deposited the other 20 lakhs in the bank.""
Me: ""How much schooling have you had?""
Vendor: ""I studied up to third standard;
I stopped my studies when I was in the 4th standard.
But I know how to read and write.
Sir, there are many people like yourself,
Who dress well, wear a tie, wear shoes,
Speak English fluently and work in air-conditioned rooms.
But I don't think you guys earn as much
As we do wearing dirty clothes and selling samosas.""
At this point, what could I reply. After all, I was talking to a
Millionaire! The train chugged into khar station
And the samosa vendor got up from his seat.
Vendor: ""Sir, this is my station...have a good day.""
Me: ""Take care.""

779,"Q: Can an average student get into the IIMs?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

Let me tell you something about my background

I was a pretty average student throughout my life(Now the word ""average"" is relative.Let me give you an idea of how average I was.)

I never got more than 80% in my whole school life until class X despite studying in ICSE board (which is known for generously awarding marks).Never participated in any extra co-curricular activities in either my school or even in mine college.

When I was in class X out of 51 students only 2 were deemed to be not fit for any responsibility in school(school captain, house captain,perfect).I was 1 among those two.

Scored 94% in my class X exams.(Broke 5 bones one day prior to my board exams. So had to spend 30 days indoor thus I was able to spend a lot of time with my books)

Parents had high expectations of me at this point.Despite facing some very hard financial conditions at home my dad decided to sent me to KOTA(Bansal classes).Nearly spend 2 years of my life there .Couldn't clear IITJEE(That's a different story).Spent nearly 5 lakh  of my fathers hard earned money and had a rank of 44,000 in AIEEE.

Scored only 69% in my class XII exams.(Do remember that I had 94 in my X,that was a huge dip)

My confidence was shattered. My heart wanted to drop one year and take a go again at IIT but my low confidence didn't allow me to take the plunge.

Took admission in one of the private colleges of my state.First year was pretty easy. 2nd was a bit tougher. This is my CGPA semester wise:
8.22 in 1st sem.
8.11 in 2nd sem.
7.11 in 3rd sem.
6.94 in 4th sem.(with 1 backlog)

Let me tell you despite having a DGPA of 8.02 in my college I am not even in top 70% of my batch.Our university was quite generous in offering marks.The only person to be blamed was me.

I was even not able to get a single internship in my whole college life despite applying to fifty or so places.

This was the turning point of my life.I wasn't even sure if I would be landing up with a job at any mass recruiter as I would be having 1 backlog pending at the time of placements.

I had three choices :
1)Quit studies and join my fathers shop.
2)Complete my graduation any how and then look to change my field.
3)Let things as they are.

I decided to choose the second option.I decided to write CAT.

Difficulties faced:
1) I had very poor acad 12-69%,graduation-7.5 cgpa (till then)
2)As you can figure out my English skills are not top notch,and this was a serious handicap which I had to overcome.
3)I had nothing on my CV literally.(Never participated in any college fest,quiz,nothing except the occasional bong / weed )My classmates included national level scholarship winners ,coders ,debaters . I was a NOBODY.
4)I am a GEM and fresher too coupled with low acad. Recipe for disaster!!

No gambler worth his salt would have bet his money on me.

I went and asked my father for 31,000 for my CAT coaching.Took 1 week to convince him to pay for my fees.(He had lost nearly all his confidence in me and neither do I blame him)

I gave in my all for CAT.Read numerous blogs on the net . Did the coaching classes diligently.  Practice a lot for 1 year. Gave the mocks with all seriousness .Tried to improve my CGPA as much as I could.

Was getting 99%ile plus consistently in mocks at Career launcher. In the penultimate mock I got 99.94%ile.

Meanwhile the placement season arrived. The floodgates opened. Many companies were providing packages of nearly 16 LPA , others were providing 8 lpa. But as luck would have it, companies followed a prerequisite of CGPA>8 cut-off rule,others followed 70% throughout. So had my fair shares of rejection before I was even allowed to sit for the placement. I got job offers from 4 companies (Albeit not any core companies.All were offering nearly 3.5 LPA. No regrets though, We are responsible for our past actions)

Took CAT 2014 on 22nd Nov. Result were out on 27th Dec .Tragedy had struck again. I got 97.97%ile . It was far lower than what was expected (I used to always think that if I get a higher percentile it might compensate my abysmal academics)

I didn't land up any call from any of the 7 old IIMs. Got call from all the 6 new IIMs (RRRTKU).

I clearly remember the day when we were asked to fill up a form on line asking to give in your academic,co-curricular and extra - curricular achievement. I so wanted to skip the PI and give CAT again but better sense prevailed.

I went blank seeing the form.I kept the form blank. My document verification took 1 minute only.(Had the smallest form)

I was so unsure about myself back then that I didn't even buy a suit for my interview.I just wore a tie,shirt and pant.I was so sure of not being selected that 15,000 needed for the suit seemed like a waste of money.I did buy one later when I got a call from IIM C(PGDBA course).

Had a wonderful PI. Talked about myself with all honesty.Interviewers loved it. At the end of the year I had converts from 10 IIMs (IIM Raipur, IIM Rohtak, IIM Trichy, IIM Udaipur, IIM Kashipur, IIM Bodh Gaya, IIM Shambalpur, IIM Vizag, IIM Nagpur, IIM Srimaur. Didn't even apply to IIM Amritsar as I was pretty sure by then what I wanted to do).

Decided not to do the same mistake which I did in 12. Rejected all the admits.Will be taking CAT 2015 again this year. Not even joining the companies I had offer letters from .Hopefully I will do better this time.

I was a pathetic student and I rejected IIMs(although the new ones).

I mean no disrespect to any IIM.I know some of my friend those who will sell their kidneys to get  in new IIMs. But at the end of the day it depends where you see yourself some years down the line.

""Success is never final and failure never fatal. It's courage that counts""

The eagle story. Changes for survival.

Eagle can live up to 70 years, but to reach this age, the eagle must make a hard decision in its' 40's.

Its' long & flexible talons can no longer grab prey which serves as food, its' long & sharp beak becomes bent.

Its' old-aged & heavy wings, due to their thick feathers, become stuck to its' chest & make it difficult to fly.

Then eagle is left with only 2 options: Die or go through a painful process of change which lasts 150 days. 

The process requires that eagle fly to a mountain & the eagle knocks its' beak against a rock until it plucks it out. 

After this, eagle will wait for a new beak to grow back. when its' new talons grow back, the eagle starts plucking its' old-aged feathers & after 5 months, eagle can take its' flight of rebirth & lives for 30 more years 

Moral of story :-

Many times, in order to survive, we have to start a change process. we sometimes need to get rid of old memories, habits & other past traditions only freed from past burdens,we can take advantage of the present.

Q:- What is the best reply if my parents tease me by asking if i've a girlfriend.?

A:- (During my college life, I always travelled from Aligarh with a Girl who lives in Pilibhit and myself living in Budaun. My dad used to pick me up from station and always stared us as if he's gonna kill me if she's my girlfriend. Although she is the most beautiful girl that made others jealous of being with her. But after reaching to my hometown, I usually got those frowned eyes on me)

One day before returning to my home.

Dad: Are you coming today?
Me: Yes!
Dad: With her again? 
Me: (Two minute silence for me)

I told her about this problem while travelling. She said she can help you out.

And what she did was, she took out her Duppatta (I don't know what to say in English) over her head and asked the bus conductor for a ticket till Badaun. I'm hopeless what's in her mind. I was scared.

After hours, bus stopped at Badaun station. She took her luggage and waited for my father to come. Her duppatta was still at her head that made my sweat out.

Dad: (Did the same again, staring at us) 
She: Pitaji, Main Pragya. Aapki bete ki girlfriend. (Father, I'm Pragya, your son's girlfriend)

Me: (Pokerfaced!, Seriously my eyes were filled with tears as if I'm watching insidious or conjuring)

Dad: What are you saying. My son can never do that.
Me (Relief for brief)
She: Then why do you question him always?

She went back to bus after that for a journey. I was still trembling while sitting behind my dad on Bike. 

But that seriously worked. He never asked me, I never asked her.

790,"This is a story I heard during my one year stay at Kota for JEE preparation! 

There were two brothers. With a difference of one year in their ages. I dont exactly remember their names. So, lets assume A was the elder one, and the other was B. 

So, A had given JEE as a fresher. But he failed to clear it. Now both A and B had to appear Jee the next year. 

About A, he was a mediocre, an average guy. Not sure of cracking Jee. His teachers too didn't expect much from him. A four digit rank was the least they were expecting from him. 

Whereas B was a bright student. A two digit rank was a sure shot prediction from his teachers. 

Now coming to the story, both the brothers had a year left. A, being already faced the exam once, knew well the mistakes he committed. He had in mind all the loopholes that he left in his 2 years of preparation. 

While A was unsure of his selection even for the second time too, he wanted his younger brother to come out with flying colours. He already knew his younger brother's potential. 

So, A used to keep giving advice to his younger brother. As to how to prepare well, how to minimise mistakes. He shared his experiences, yeah not fictional but real life experiences that he had in the past couple of years.

This thing hurt or rather irritated B to such extent that he burst out one day saying, "" Bhaiya, leave, you were not even able to clear JEE. Then how are you expecting me to score well with your suggestions. I am good, and i will crack JEE this year with a good rank. What about you? Focus on your paper and try to clear the exam, leave beside the rank.""

These few lines were the turning point, you can say, for A. This had a long lasting impact on A. He started preparing for JEE even more vigorously. 

Finally, the exam day came. A wished good luck to B before leaving for exam centre. But, B didn't even reply back.

They both wrote the exam.

And then the results came. 
A had a rank between 1-10
B had a rank between 30-40

Both the brothers were ecstatic. A went straight to B and thanked him. In reply, B burst out in tears, apologising for his rude and disrespectful behaviour."

This happened during my school days : 

Scene : Typical boring Hindi class. My classmate and I were restless to leave the class and join my friends for the dance rehersal for the upcoming annual day.

I gathered some courage and broke the silence, ""Sir, may I join my dance group for the dance rehersal?""
(Assuming the fact that if he allows me, so  will he do to my classmate)

Sir : ""yes, you may leave!"" (I was elated!)
He went back to teach Hindi poetry, and seemed to be in a good mood. 
Perfect timing.
I waited for my classmate's turn to ask  for permission to join me. But she was too afraid to ask; I sensed the tacit request to help her through her gaze. 

Me: ""Sir, Mona ko bhi saath mein le jaa sakti hun? Woh hamare saath hai dance mein.""( Can Mona accompany me as she is too a participant?)

Sir: (trying to dismiss my request with poetic twist)""Duniya mein akele hi aaye the, akele hi jaoge..""

801,"An Interesting Story

Never underestimate your Clients' Complaint, no matter how funny it might
seem!

This is a real story that happened between the customer of General Motors and its Customer-Care Executive. Pls read on.....

A complaint was received by the Pontiac Division of General Motors:

'This is the second time I have written to you, and I don't blame you for not answering me, because I sounded crazy, but it is a fact that we have a tradition in our family of Ice-Cream for dessert after dinner each night, but the kind of ice cream varies so, every night, after we've eaten, the whole family votes on which kind of ice cream we should have and I drive
down to the store to get it. It's also a fact that I recently purchased a new Pontiac and since then my trips to the store have created a problem.....

You see, every time I buy a vanilla ice-cream, when I start back from the store my car won't start. If I get any other kind of ice cream, the car starts just fine. I want you to know I'm serious about this question, no matter how silly it sounds ""What is there about a Pontiac that makes it not start when I get vanilla ice cream, and easy to start whenever I get any other kind?"" The Pontiac President was understandably skeptical about the letter, but sent an Engineer to check it out anyway.

The latter was surprised to be greeted by a successful, obviously well
educated man in a fine neighborhood. He had arranged to meet the man just after dinner time, so the two hopped into the car and drove to the ice
cream store. It was vanilla ice cream that night and, sure enough, after they came back to the car, it wouldn't start.

The Engineer returned for three more nights. The first night, they got
chocolate. The car started. The second night, he got strawberry. The car
started. The third night he ordered vanilla. The car failed to start.

Now the engineer, being a logical man, refused to believe that this man's
car was allergic to vanilla ice cream. He arranged, therefore, to continue his visits for as long as it took to solve the problem. And toward this end he began to take notes: He jotted down all sorts of data: time of day, type of gas uses, time to drive back and forth etc.

In a short time, he had a clue: the man took less time to buy vanilla than
any other flavor. Why? The answer was in the layout of the store. Vanilla, being the most popular flavor, was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick pickup. All the other flavors were kept in the back of the store at a different counter where it took considerably longer to check out the flavor.

Now, the question for the Engineer was why the car wouldn't start when it
took less time. E..ureka - Time was now the problem - not the vanilla ice cream!!!! The engineer quickly came up with the answer: ""vapor lock"".

It was happening every night; but the extra time taken to get the other
flavors allowed the engine to cool down sufficiently to start. When the man
got vanilla, the engine was still too hot for the vapor lock to dissipate.

Even crazy looking problems are sometimes real and all problems seem to be simple only when we find the solution, with cool thinking.

Don't just say it is "" IMPOSSIBLE"" without putting a sincere effort....
What really matters is your attitude and your perception.

Unacademy is impacting more people than some of the top educational startups of the country. Google trends can agree to that :) 

Roman Saini, co-founder and chief educator at unacademy is an IAS officer and a doctor from AIIMS. This doesn't usually happen that a person with that credentials starts teaching and creating a huge impact. 

This is probably one of the best examples of Make in India."
804,"In the legal course we had in business school, the law professor would say - ""It is my job to be the no man and your job to be the yes man"". A leader by nature is an optimist. He sees a rosy path. His counsel by nature should be a pessimist. He should point to the thorns. 

The reason why we have two different roles - RBI governor and Finance Minister - to manage the economy is essentially along the lines. Like yin and yang, tester and developer, they complement each other. 

RBI governors like all bankers and lawyers are selected to be very conservative. They have to look for the worst case. When the bankers party, things collapse like it happened in 2008. 

On the other hand, an executive cannot be that sullen and pessimistic. That would break the system as the gloominess would catch on. He/she has to be the chief cheerleader to get the system going. They have to find a smile even when the situation is deadly. Because, they are the morale boosters.

When Raghuram Rajan is pessimistic and Narendra Modi is optimistic, it means both of them are doing their jobs. They differ because one is looking at the worst case and the other at the best case."
805,"I screwed up 12th boards, IIT-JEE and AIEEE because I was too overconfident of myself. Post my 10th board results where I scored 95%+, everyone (friends, family, relatives) thought that I would be taking admission into one of the top colleges of the country be it engineering or medical or others.
 
Instead I took admission into a college which is so unknown that it probably doesn't even feature in the top 200 engineering colleges of India. My parents stopped believing in me from that day. So much so that when I disclosed my intention to do an MBA, my dad, very calmly, said that I don't have the capability to fulfill those humongoues dreams and instead should focus on getting a placement in some IT company first.
 
That statement of my dad turned the tables for me. 
 
I started working rigorously for MBA entrance exams with only one goal of breaking into the top 25 B-Schools of India. 
 
The Result?
 
Only one call from my target set.
 
I cried on the day the results were out because for the first time I was losing confidence on myself.
 
It required another intervention from my Dad. This time, he said, 
 
""You have worked so hard for proving me wrong and now you have only chance for proving me completely wrong. Do you want to waste that last chance by crying?""
 
I finally converted that only call on the first list and am presently employed in one of the world's largest Non-Banking Financial Corporation at Mumbai.
 
My Learnings?
 
1. Screwing up exams is a part and parcel of life. We don't care when we are in the process of screwing it up until reality strikes. You have to decide what do you want to do then? Sit back and ponder over what went right or think ahead of how to make that wrong right?
 
2. There might be times when nobody and absolutely nobody will trust you. You will again have two options. Prove them right or Prove them wrong. Your choice.
 
3. You are your greatest motivation, your greatest strength. Don't let it fade away."

It's the best story not about India but about Humanity itself.

I visited India back in 2004 with my family to visit some relatives. Our trip of 1.5 months went pretty well and now we were planning to come back. Our flight was from Mumbai to Karachi and my uncle's house was in Rajasthan state so we hire a jeep to travel from Rajasthan to Bombay. We put our luggage on the top of the Jeep and knot it with rope and started our journey. It was a long and tiring journey and it was Ramazan. Me and my family was on fasting and we just entered in Mumbai and it was almost sunset time. We were very thirsty and hungry then suddenly a guy came to us and said, 

""You guys must be Muslims and its time to break the fast and you probably don't know much places in here"" (may be he knew from our luggage). 

Then he offered us to come and sit in his restaurant and there I had the best pineapple juice of my life. He even offer us the place to pray.

But the best part is, he was a Hindu(non-muslim) person and he didn't charge us any money for the food and drinks of 8 people and that's the best fast of my life and I still pray for that guy."

Hi I am from the 2004 Manu/Indu Dual Degree course. My interview with Dassault Systemes was held at 1 AM in the night !! I was already bored by that time and had a mental state of ""How cool is this but Fuck it, I'm going to be myself""

After looking at the Marksheet Mr Ravikiran asked me

1st Question: Why are your grades so low?
Me: Because I don't study
Ravikiran: Then why should I take you
Me: If you want me to study in your company, please don't take me
(BAMMM !!)

2nd Question: But give me a reason.
Me: I don't study but I can do a lot
Ravikiraan: Prove it
Me: Sir, I have B,C and D in theory subjects but Ex in ALL the lab course. This obviously proves that I don't study but can do a lot
(BAMMM !!)

3rd Question: What's your favourite subject?
Me: Engineering Drawing !
Ravikiran: But everybody hates it !!
Me: I like it when I can do things which others can't
Ravikiran: Yes, but I can't ask a ED question. Tell me some other subject
Me: Control Systems and Bond Graphs
Ravikiran: But everybody hates that too ?
Me: Now you know why I like it ;)
(BAMMM !!)

Ravikiran: OK fine your interview is done, Thanks. (Total 7-10 minutes maybe)

Result: Total 5 from my batch. 4 of them above 8.5 CGPA and 1 (Me) at 7.32 :)

Epilogue: 
When all 5 of us went to Bangalore for joining 1 year later the HR asked the remaining 4 which department would they like to join based on their interests. I was NOT asked this question. So I thought ""WTF, CGPA discrimination even after graduating?"". So I asked the HR ""Peter, what about my choice?"". He took me to the side and said,"" Alok, I don't know what you did in the interview but right after that Ravikiran came to me and told me ""I don't care which team the other 4 go to, but I want Alok in my team"".  That is why you are not being given a choice"" 

...... wait for it.... wait for it .... (BAMMM !!)

So folks: CGPA is important but not everything in life !! So chill a bit more and be yourself !"

This morning, I got a text from a friend I haven't been in contact with for the past 2 years. Two years ago, when we graduated from college, he went to do PGDM from an IIM and I started preparing for civils. 

Just to make it clear, we weren't the best of friends. We were just friends, often hanging out in the same group of people, or sometimes I would sleep over at his place because he lived alone and we both liked to play chess and poker. So, when we parted ways after college, there was no contact.

Now, today morning he texted me from abroad. And this is what he had to say. ""Bhai, I just need someone to talk to me. I haven't talked to a friend in 3 weeks."" 

This is a guy who is working with one of the biggest investment banks in the world and earning a handsome salary. He is living the 'dream' of a lot of people but when he felt lonely, he called someone he hasn't been in contact with for 2 years. Just imagine how lonely he must really be.

I have always found him somewhat non-sentimental, and he is definitely not one to be emotional, but today he was reminiscing about college life. He was missing all the friendships he had and destroyed (most of them unintentionally and just because he couldn't find time for them).

So, coming to your question... No, life is not all about a career.

Life is about a lot of things, but it is mostly about the people in it. The people that you begin with, and the people that you meet along the way. The people that are there when things go bad, and the people that are there to rejoice in your success. It's these people that make life worth living.

We always want what we don't have and take what we have for granted. The grass always seems to be greener on the other side. But it's only after we have lost what we had, do we realize its importance. Now, the sad part about that realization is that more often than not, it's too late to go back. The people you wish to keep close have already moved on.

She had long been  suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her  more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she  started to wonder if there was more between Kumar and his roommate than  met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, Kumar volunteered, ""I know  what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Sunita and I are just  roommates.""

So he sat down and wrote :

I'm  not saying that you 'did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not  saying that you 'did not' take the silver plate.. But the fact remains  that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Dear Wife, 

I’m writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you forever. I've been a good man to you for 7 years & I have nothing to show for it. These last 2 weeks have been hell. ... Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw. Last week, you came home & didn't even notice I had a new haircut, had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You ate in 2 minutes, & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps. You don’t tell me you love me anymore; you don’t want sex or anything that connects us as husband & wife. Either you’re cheating on me or you don’t love me anymore; whatever the case, I’m gone.
Your EX-Husband

P.S. don’t try to find me. Your SISTER & I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life!

Dear Ex-Husband,

Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It’s true you & I have been married for 7 years, although a good man is a far cry from what you've been. I watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping Too bad that doesn't work. I DID notice when you got a hair cut last week, but the 1st thing that came to mind was ‘You look just like a girl!’ Since my mother raised me not to say anything if you can’t say something nice, I didn't comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork 7 years ago. About those new silk boxers: I turned away from you because the $49.99 price tag was still on them, & I prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed $50 from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you & felt we could work it out. So when I hit the lotto for 10 million dollars, I quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to Jamaica But when I got home you were gone.. Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won’t get a dime from me. So take care.

Signed, Your Ex-Wife, Rich As Hell & Free!
P.S. I don’t know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla was born Carl. I hope that’s not a problem"

There was a king. He had 10 wild dogs...
He used them to torture and eat all the ministers who made mistakes.

Once, one of the ministers gave an opinion which was wrong, and which the king didn’t like at all… 
So he ordered for the minister to be thrown to the dogs.

So the minister said, 
""I served you 10 years and you do this..?

Please give me 10 days before you throw me in with those dogs!""
So the king agreed… 

In those 10 days the minister went to the guard that was guarding the dogs and told him he wants to serve the dogs for the next 10 days… 

The guard was baffled… 
But he agreed… 
So the minister started feeding the dogs, cleaning them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort to them.

When the 10 days were up… 

The king ordered that the minister be thrown in to the dogs as his punishment.

But when he was thrown in, 

Everyone was amazed at what they saw..
They saw the dogs licking the feet of the minister!

So the king, baffled at what he saw, said:” what happened to my dogs. !!!” 

The minister then said;” 
I served the dogs for 10 days and they didn’t forget my service…
Yet I served you for 10 years and you forgot all on the first mistake!”…

I do not want to purposely turn your rich, happy and pleasant life into a sad, desolate and poor one. My family would have clipped your wings and had sucked the colour and liveliness out of your life on the name of protection. I am up for women equality and their rights.

This happened to me a month back. I was in a year long relationship with a girl who seemed to be nice first. Recently I moved to another city , distance increased (both physical and  emotional).

One fine day, I slept early to compensate for many sleepless nights. Woke up to see 27 missed calls and 31 messages from her. In her last message she said that its over and not to contact her anymore. Other 30 messages were only 'hi','hey','what happened',etc... I tried to call her, whats-app her, Facebook her but I was blocked in all of them. (Weird)

This made me all curious. I at least deserved to know the reason for all this drama. So I called her from my friend's number, she picked up, after hearing my voice she hung up. It didn't stop me. I called her from all the phones that I could find near me. 

Finally she decided to answer.
I told her that I don't want to patch up just want to know the reason for the sudden breakup.

Here it comes (drum roll). These were her exact words ""You talk a lot with your mom, if you want to continue in this relationship you have to promise me that you will never talk with your mom"". I had only three words for her ""F**k you bitch""."
823,"I had just reached  the railway station and was waiting for my train to arrive as I had to travel to Ahmedabad(Gujarat) for a family function of my friend. When I asked the Train Enquiry Department, they told me that the train will arrive at 9.00 pm, which meant I had to wait for an extra hour. So I tried to pass my time by having a look at the station and the things happening there. Since it was a small station, there were very few passengers. 

I saw a group of boys playing with the pebbles. The boys were all dressed up quite pathetically as their clothes were very dirty and torn.  But still they were quite happy with the pebbles and were enjoying to the fullest.

 Suddenly I developed an urge to drink tea as it was a cold evening, but to my misfortune, I couldn't find any tea vendors at the station. The only tea vendor was sitting outside the station and I couldn't take the risk of leaving all my luggage at the station just to drink the tea. 

I called one of the boys from the guys and asked him to bring me a cup of tea by handing him a coin of 5 rupees. He agreed and went to bring me the tea.

Time passed and after half an hour,I heard the announcement which  said that my train would be arriving in a couple of minutes. Now I was sure that the child ran away with the money and cursed myself for trusting a ROADSIDE Boy. 

I stood up to pick my luggage as the train arrived. I was just about  to enter the coach when I heard a voice which said 'Babuji, Apki chai' (translates to 'Sir, your tea')

Surprised with the voice, I looked back and asked him,Why  did he bring the tea so late ?

He told me, he lost the 5 rupees coin and so he had to clean the utensils of the tea vendor, to bring me a cup of tea!!

A 10-year-old boy decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident. The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. 

The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move.
""Sensei,"" the boy finally said, ""Shouldn't I be learning more moves?""

""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,""the sensei replied.

Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training. Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament.

Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches.

The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his only move to win the match.

Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals. This time, his opponent was bigger and stronger. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out.

He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened. ""No,"" the sensei insisted, ""Let him continue."" 
Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him.

The boy had won the match and the tournament.

""Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?""

""You won for two reasons,"" the sensei answered. ""First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defence for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.""

The boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.

""Sometimes we feel that we have certain weaknesses and we blame the circumstances and ourselves for it but we never know that our weakness can become our strength one day."" 

Moral: Your hardwork can turn weakness into strength.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

I was arrested for talking to an Indian woman.

First of all, FIR is a police report in India, and it stands for First Information Report.

So I just got home after a GRUELLING day.

I have some knee problems these days. I went to see a specialist. He saw my X-ray report and recommended a few exercises, along with meds and told me to come back in two weeks.

My mother was there with me, and she suffers from arthritis. She was getting her diagnosis, while I was already free.

I saw this doctor, she looked nice. I didn't approach her, for her colleagues and patients were all around her. We had a good eye contact a couple of times. My Mom told me that it'd take her a few more minutes, and I encouraged her to take her time.

In about 15 minutes, this doctor, this woman... she got out of her room and walked towards the stairs. I followed her, and basically asked her to stop. 

Me: Stop
She: Yes?
Me: We should get together this weekend.
Her: Why?
Me: We'll have fun. Maybe get a cup of coffee or something!
Her: Get lost...

I walked away and sat down on the sofa, waiting for my Mom to come back.

In a few minutes, the chief of security asked me to step into his office. I went there. The woman had apparently complained that I had harassed her. Her boss, the senior doctor (SD) was also there. 

SD: What did you say to her?
Me: To who?
SD: To her... (pointing to her)
Me: What's it to you?
SD: I'll tell what it is to me you punk. I'll call the cops.
Me: I merely asked her out, she said no, and I walked away.
SD: (To his security staff) Don't let him go.

So I went back and sat on my chair. In a couple minutes, my Mom stepped into the room, and signaled that she was ready to leave. We left, but since my knees were hurting, I didn't walk fast. In less than 30 seconds, almost 30 security people surrounded me, four or five jumped me, and forcefully dragged me back in.

At this point, my Mom went berserk. She started crying and begging and pleading. She didn't know what the deal was. She started crying hysterically. With all that commotion, all eyes were on me. I could literally feel the heat of hatred from all those eyeballs, but I thought to myself, ""No matter. I didn't do anything wrong.""

In that dragging, my shirt got torn too.

Whatever.

I went back inside, and sought to speak to some senior doctor. I thought maybe the SD I had spoken to earlier might want to reason. But upon seeing me, he told me that he'd destroy me. His words, not mine.

My mother is crying and begging now, at this point. She tells me to apologize. I say, ""Look I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. But if I stepped over any toes or crossed any lines, then I apologize. I didn't mean to disrespect anyone.""

The police arrive. Some Policemen. They ask me what happened. Then they ask the girl what happened. I don't know what she told them. I told them exactly what had happened, and I was pretty sure that they'd side with me seeing as how nothing really had happened.

Lo and behold, the policemen sided with the doctors. What's more, some of her friends step in (as I was later told) and told the cops that I had been ""eyeballing"" other women too. 

Indian Government have started a woman's helpline, where any woman can seek help if she is being molested. This happened right after the brutal Delhi rape case a couple months ago. Apparently, she (or the SD) had called up that helpline and told them that I had harassed her, molested her, touched her and held her hand. I know I didn't even go for a hand shake.

They were now waiting for the ""victim's"" husband and father to arrive to file an FIR. My mother was going berserk seeking forgiveness. Honestly, I didn't know what to do. I tried to tell my Mom to leave, and to let me take care of it, but even she started blaming me for being an asshole. Whatever!

In unison, everyone agreed that asking her out was outraging her modesty, and that I had been completely unethical. Moral policing is one of the hobbies of Delhi police anyway, and seemingly that of every Indian who can speak.

Finally, the husband arrived. 

I had half expected him to respond with madness, and half with sanity. He chose total madness. He walked up to me and slapped me right on my ear without hearing a word. The police didn't do anything to stop him, and I had to reason with him with statements like, ""Look, I didn't touch her"" and ""I didn't mean any disrespect"" and ""I didn't know she was married."" He didn't calm down.

In the end, after all this hassle an FIR was filed, and I was immediately arrested. This happened around 11 AM. I was taken to a police station and put behind the bars.

As you can imagine, my mother was hysterical. She called up all my aunts and uncles and sought help from them. I don't know what happened next, but all I know is that someone bailed me out. They had to pay a good amount of money to a lawyer to arrange that for me. 

We didn't bribe... We got bail, and the money was spent on the lawyer's fee and bail amount.

I have a criminal mind according to my entire family. I saw the same hatred being reflected from the eyes of my uncles, and aunts, and Mom as I had observed in those doctors' and nurses'.

I got home after having being locked up in prison for 7 hours. I hadn't eaten anything since last night.

I have decided never to approach women anymore... at least as long as I am in India... Even if it means that I don't ever get laid again. Women have too much power in the system. I don't know how much money and time I will end up losing in this court case. Pretty sure they will confiscate my passport for as long as the trial lasts. And trials in this country last decades.

I am an outcast on so many levels.

I am numb and I don't know what I did to deserve this.

I don't even know what I am looking for here... Maybe it's a little bit of compassion, for no one around me seems to think that I am innocent, and that I didn't commit any crime. Even my best buddy said ""Told you so!""

Yes, I am that severely depressed. I am numb.

Yours sadly,
A man who was victimized by a ""Victim Indian woman"" today, and is in tears

DASHRATH MANJHI was born in 1934 into a poor labourer's family in Gahlour village near Gaya in Bihar. Being illiterate, there seemed little option left for him but to spend his life working in the fields.He started working in the fields near a hill which rose on one side of his village. To cross the mountain, one had to traverse a narrow and treacherous pass.
One day, when his wife, Phaguni Devi, was crossing the pass to bring him his lunch, she slipped and hurt herself. This incident disturbed Dashrath deeply and that very night he decided to destroy the hill which had injured his wife.The next morning, armed with t a hammer and chisel, he started off on a task that was to become an obsession. ""The villagers called him a madman"".
              Dashrath's wife Falguni Devi died from lack of medical care in 1959. The nearest town with a doctor was 70 km away traveling around the hills, or along a treacherous pass through the hills. He decided to carve a path through the Gehlour hills so that his village could have easier access to medical attention.He returned to his village and carved a path 360-foot-long (110 m), 25-foot-deep (7.6 m) in places and 30-foot-wide (9.1 m) to form a road through the rocks in Gehlour hill.

He completed the work in 22 years (1960–1982). This road reduced the distance between the Atri and Wazirganj blocks of the Gaya district from 80 km to 00 km. Though mocked for his efforts, he has made life easier for people of Gehlour village. 
   
52 years after he started breaking the mountain, 30 years after he finished and 4 years after his death the government finally made a metalled road to Gehlaur in 2011.

A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.

He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor.

On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did you take all this time to come? Don’t you know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?”

The doctor smiled & said: “I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call…… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”

“Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would you calm down? If your own son dies now what will you do??” said the father angrily

The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”

“Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.

The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy, “Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If you have any questions, ask the nurse!!”

“Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.

The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was at the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”

Oh what a night it was!

Wished life would never, ever pause.

Dancing to the tunes played by the radio,

Capturing every moment, in a video!

Somewhere on the mountainy land,

Away from the masses, soil and sand.

Remembering our family and friends,

Hope we meet, before life ends.

 

No sooner were we lost in this momentary bliss,

Than our sharp ears noticed a distant hiss.

Up and Alarmed! We take our positions,

Guns and Rifles, loaded with ammunitions.

And Oh! The first firing starts,

And one friend, sadly, succumbs to the attacks.

With heavy hearts, yet burning desire,

The mountains we climb, higher and higer.

Shouting slogans, raising spirits, we aim and fire,

But no, it never stops, the backfire!

 

Bullets are fired and bombs explode,

Hurrah!! Finally, the enemy has slowed.

Victory shines its smile on us,

And there THE INDIAN FLAG, proudly wavers.

 

Hold on, Look back at what lays behind,

The dead remains of our friends, cold and confined.

Looks like the snow has changed its color,

Smeared with red blood, all over!

Minutes before, we were singing and dancing,

And now, some dead, some suffering.

But this shall not stop till our very last breath,

As, we will only give up, forced by death!

Either the flag flies high on the masthead,

Or we come draped in it, cold and dead!"

An old Italian lived alone in New Jersey .  He wanted to plant his annual  tomato garden, but it was very difficult work as the ground was hard.
 
His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:

Dear Vincent, 
I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over..  I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.
Love, Papa

A few days later he received a letter from his son.

Dear Papa,
Don't dig up that garden. That's where the bodies are buried.
Love,
Vinnie

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left.

That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

Dear Papa,
Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.

The reason why games like Minesweeper and Solitaire were created ..!!

Excerpt from a Quora post.

""But as fun as these games were, they weren't actually designed for entertainment. At least not in their Windows incarnations.
The oldest of the four, Microsoft Solitaire, was first added to Windows 3.0 in 1990. Although the game (sometimes called ""Patience"") has existed since the late 1700s, this digital version seemed to be demonstrating that in the future we would no longer require a physical deck to play simple card games. But that's not what it was doing at all. Its real aim was far more modest: it was teaching mouse-fluency by stealth.

The intention was that Solitaire would get a generation of computer users still most familiar with a command-line input to teach themselves how to drag and drop, without realizing that's what they were doing. The fact that we're still dragging and dropping today suggests that it worked rather well.
Minesweeper, too, has a similar place in technological culture. The numbers-based logic puzzle has roots in the mainframe gaming scene of the 1960s and 1970s, where a version called ""Cube"" by Jerimac Ratliff became incredibly popular. Decades later, in 1992, the Microsoft version Minesweeper was introduced to Windows 3.1—not to demonstrate that Windows was an adept gaming operating system, but to make the idea of left and right clicking second nature for Windows users, and to foster speed and precision in mouse movement.""

Every one in the bus were horrified by this.He started the bus and took the bus out of the station and everybody started to shout at him and started to get off from the bus.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then? Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought.

876,"Q:- Is it possible to equate the value of dollar and rupee value?

A:- Three brothers from a village moved to three different countries and settled there. In one of the countries, people measured by feet. In another country, people measured by centimeter. In the third country people measured in inches. 

During a festival, the three brothers met again. During a conversation they argued about the length of the bedroom. The guy from feetville said, it is 12 feet. The guy from centimeter ville said it is 360 cm and the guy from inchville said it is 144 inches. 

Does this change the value of the underlying room? No. Does this mean the guy who is measuring in feet is superior to the guy measuring in inches and centimeters? No.

Historically, the currencies started from various starting points. British Pound takes from the Latin measure of the pound. 1 British Pound historically meant ~450 grams of silver. On the other hand 1 Indian Rupee for centuries meant 178 grains of silver or about ~11.5 grams of silver. Does that mean the pound is better than rupee? No. 

In the past few decades, most economies moved out of gold and silver standards and thus the currencies have floated around. But, the starting point still makes a huge difference. 

It is meaningless to compare the absolute value of currencies. Japan's economy is not poorer than Kuwait's economy just because 1 Kuwait Dinar [a relatively recent creation to replace the Indian rupee] is more than 400 Japanese Yen. They are just measuring in different units. 

See the currency as units and you would find the question relatively meaningless.

883,"I was almost raped on my wedding night.

I am sure it may not be this way for all weddings out there. I am not even saying that this is the case for many weddings. But yes, if you are getting into this, you should always know that this is a possibility that you cannot ignore, and which no one would ever tell you.

I hail from a typical middle class background, from a not-so-big town in (South) India, and after I turned 22, everyone around me was worried that now is the time for me to get married otherwise I would never get married/ bring shame to my family/ marry after my younger siblings get married/ run off with someone (yes, they said all these things in front of me!) so, yes, I needed to be married off to someone, who was not my boyfriend.

Now, there's a culture in South India, if a family doesn't have a lot of money -- girls are married to their cousins/ mother's brother, where the age difference is not too much (say the mother was the eldest daughter, and brother was the youngest, with a huge age gap). This way, a girl stays 'within the family', and also there is no question of dowry, since they are family.

Similar to this, my wedding was arranged right after I graduated from college, to my ""mama"" (mother's brother) who was a few years older than me. My case was complicated because I had a boyfriend already, and my family didn't approve of him when I told them about him (he was not South Indian, which was a mortal sin in my parents' eyes). I tried to protest, but using the usual emotional blackmail arguments, my father forced me into the marriage - he was very sick at the time, and the onus was on me to ""fulfill his wishes."" (He's very much fine now, but I am inclined to think he'll fall sick again when it's my younger sister's turn to get married. Indian parents force you to think this stuff about themselves).

I was forced to break off all contact with my boyfriend (mobile, internet snatched away, I don't think I could even have sent a letter, it was so bad) and forced to dive head-first into the wedding arrangements.

The day of the wedding came, and after a really embarrassing lecture from my mother, about my ""marital duties"" since I was the eldest daughter and no friends had been allowed to my wedding (my parents believed they would whisk me away from the wedding if they came to know), I got ready for the ""wedding night."" I was already feeling completely shitty about the whole thing, having been cut off from every person that I wanted to be with, being married to my 'mama' in secrecy, and not even knowing whether to think of him as a husband or my mama, and  just wanted to sleep hoping a new day would bring a new start.

I waited for my husband to come and when he entered, we exchanged a few awkward sentences about the whole day being tiresome. I then told him ""I'm feeling very tired, I will change and go to sleep now"" but I was not prepared for what happened next. He suddenly kissed me, and I was a little taken aback, but I just pulled away slowly, and told him that I was not in the mood, and reiterated that I was very tired. He ignored me completely, and kissed me again, this time with more force, and when I tried to push him away, he slapped me.

This was followed by the most horrible experience of my life, the details of which shake me to this day, and I somehow escaped by locking myself in the bathroom.

I knew I had nobody to turn to -- he was my mother's brother, and my father was sick. Even if these were not the circumstances, I doubt anyone would have supported me.

I stayed in this abusive marriage for a few months, which was the darkest period of my life. Thankfully, I was not foolish, and I had a job to support myself, unlike a lot of other women out there, suffering daily. I ran away, before it was too late. Now, nobody in my family knows where I am, and what happened. I am sure they must say the worst things about me, and mention my name with disgust and shame. But this is one decision that I made with careful deliberation and I will not let myself regret it. I am considerably happier now, very much single, with no intention of getting married again.

I am happy to have put this behind me, but want to extend my support for all those women who are in the same situation as I was. One experience is enough to scar you for life.

Driver : Yes sir, but when you meet someone new you can tell proudly what you do. I cannot do that.

Me : Why so ?

Driver : Sir nobody cares about drivers. Yes we earn a lot compared to the the IT guys, but we have no respect in the society.

Driver : Today, you are the only one who actually spoke to me. Most of them who were in my cab, didn't even bother asking about me. They are either busy on their phones or they have their earphones on.

( I really didn't know what to say )

After dropping me

Me : Sir, from next time, if I am working, please do pick me up. I had fun talking to you.

Driver : Thank you sir.

Me : I have some time left, would like to have a tea?

Driver : No sir, I have to go. I have a drop scheduled now.

Me : Okay. See you

I went inside and asked few people about what they do when they are in Cab. Yup, the driver was right. Apart from 1 or 2, I did not find anybody who talks to their cab driver.

Now, why I am saying this ?

Every profession is EQUAL! We have to give respect to what they do. Just because they are Cab drivers, we cannot overlook them.

After all, they are Humans too.

The Indian who was instrumental in the formation of GOOGLE.

So there is a long list of all the top Indian achievers in the States. From Rajat Gupta to Satya Nadella, from Indra Nooyi to Vikram Pandit, from Sundar Pichai to Vinod Khosla, but this man never features in any of them. He is still unheard and unknown of in the mainstream media.

He was so instrumental that simply put it GOOGLE WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED TODAY BUT FOR HIM.

Ram Shriram ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Shriram )

So when Larry Page and Sergey Brin met at Stanford, they were just young twenty year olds with an idea of a search engine. They explained this idea to their professor who helped them meet some investors. A majority of them were not-so-impressed by this. Then, they stumbled upon this investor called Ram Shriram who also found it OK. But, he was impressed by their passion so without thinking much he handed them a cheque of 500,000 dollars.
Can you imagine the duo didn't even have a bank account at that time to deposit that cheque?
And then as they say “the rest is history""

Ram Shriram since then has been on it's board and when Google went public, he became one of the richest guys in the world. Apart from this, he has also sold his company Junglee to Amazon and has founded many other ventures. Currently, he devotes a majority of his time to philanthropic causes in India, especially in the education sector.

903,"AN INCIDENT FROM THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN

On his first day in office as President, when Abraham Lincoln entered to give his inaugural address, one man stood up. He was a rich Aristocrat. He said, “Mr. Lincoln, you should not forget that your father used to make shoes for my family.” And the whole Senate laughed; they thought they had made a fool of Lincoln.

But certain people are made of a totally different mettle. Lincoln looked at the man directly in the eye and said, “Sir, I know that my father used to make shoes for your family, and there will be many others here. Because he made shoes the way nobody else can, he was a creator. His shoes were not just shoes; he poured his whole soul into them. I want to ask you, have you any complaint? Because I know how to make shoes myself. If you have any complaint I can make you another pair of shoes. But as far as I know, nobody has ever complained about my father’s shoes. He was a genius, a great creator and I am proud of my father”.

The whole Senate was struck dumb. They could not understand what kind of man Abraham Lincoln was. He was proud because his father did his job so well that not even a single complaint had ever been heard.

Remember: 
“No one can hurt you without your consent.”
“It is not what happens to us that hurts us. It is our response that hurts us.

906,"I think I am the most qualified to answer this question:

1. Both my parents don't have a graduation degree. Both are educated till 12th. But believe me, they are too smart for me.

2. Their marriage was inter-caste and they were abandoned by their parents. Still, their parents used to take their salaries away to compensate for their investment (in bringing up)  and they had to silently bear it.

3. My grandparents plotted to murder my mom but the guy who was supposed to kill her was good at heart. He left her alive and advised her to stay away from these people.

4. Despite the poverty, they did all they could to educate me. During those days where they hardly earned enough to eat, they left their jobs to shift to a small town to provide me better schooling.

5.They actually showed me how being poor is fun. We enjoyed working as daily labor to build our home. We enjoyed those Sunday ""vacations"" where we used to go to a nearby pond to wash clothes and I had a great swim.

6.We didn't have a TV till I was in the 5th grade. When I needed some entertainment, my mom would start singing (she's awesome at this) and my dad would start tapping on my writing pad. I used to sleep off to that.

7. We have a family dancing ritual. My dad suddenly starts dancing when a good song plays on TV. And I join. My mom is more of a singer.

8. When we finally had a TV, we couldn't afford cable. So I used to watch those hindi Doordarshan programs even if I didn't know Hindi. I could sing the entire title song of chandrakantha :P

9.They enjoy my success more than I do and mourn my failures more than I do. Despite being financially poor, we were never poor on happiness.

10. We are a sentimental small family. When someone gets hurt in the family, we pretend to be strong and then cry when we are alone (happened many times)

Whatever I am, I owe it to them. I would be nothing without them. 
And when I hear my mom/dad proudly say ""The first graduate in my family is from IIM Ahmedabad"", I feel blessed.

I knew a guy from Varanasi who dropped a year for IIT and NITs. The guy was confident he would qualify NITs ( if not IITs). So much so, he didn't even fill the forms for any other engineering exams. He gave the JEE first (those days the JEE amd AIEEE were two separate exams). His paper didn't go so good, though he was hoping he would get the bottom ranks. His AIEEE paper was a fiasco. He completely messed up in one of the sections and he knew he would never get a good rank. He had also filled up the form for BSc from Banaras Hindu University. This was just to give his parents a peace of mind who thought he needed a backup college. Also the University was in walking distance from his home. Though he had filled up the form, he was completely against the idea of doing a BSc. After all he was confident he can do well in the engineering exams. He grudgingly gave the BSc entrance exam.

A couple of weeks, hours of score calculating and waiting later,the results finally came out. He didn't make it to IIT, missed the cut off score by a couple marks. He never had big hopes for AIEEE either. He got a bad rank there as well. So the guy took the option he never thought he would take. He took up the BSc course. 

The first few months were awful. All his friends were in engineering colleges and he was stuck in a college and with a course which was not his plan at all. He could see he had disappointed his parents. Even relavtives who knew nothing about science or engineering gave him advice to join up some random college as they had good advertisement in papers. His father's colleagues suggested career options for him, often bragging about the courses and placements of their son's college. It was a really depressing time for him. All he did was shut himself off in the room and tried to avoid his parents. He even wanted to give another shot to engineering next year.

However soon things started to change. Though he was never fond of the place, he always attended the classes. And when the quiz scores came back in he was among the top in his class. His subjects were Statistics, Maths and Computer Science. He took this subject combination only because he never felt a connection with Physics. Physics never really interested him at all. So he avoided any subject combination which involved Physics. As a BSc course in science doesn't have a plethora of options, he was left with an unusual combination. He started developing an interest in statistics. He also had an interest in coding and performed the best in the computer science class as well.

Finally the end sem results came out. He was among the top 5 in his class. This was a first since his initial school days. He slowly forgot his ambition in engineering and started focusing on his subjects. He slowly started getting back his confidence, one small step at a time.

In his second year, he came to know about an entrance exam called IIT JAM. This fairly unheard of exam was for admission into various MSc courses in IIT. He looked up the subjects offered and saw a course called Applied Statistics and Informatics in IIT Bombay. This immediately caught his attention. Here he was, with a course he loved and was getting good at and a chance in an institution which he dreamed off ever since high school. Can this be it? His second chance?

He quickly started reading more and more about the exam. The specifics, the coursework required, the syllabus, everything relevant. He felt a burning desire to succeed, to perform, something he had never felt while preparing for IIT JEE. Moreover, it was a subject he was fond off. 

He started preparing. Reading texts from different authors, finding out the intricacies of the subject. All keeping in mind that he HAD to get it right this time. He saw it as his second chance, his redemption. He sought help from his seniors, made notes, solved questions. So much so he started enjoying the preparation part. This was a surprise for him because he never particularly enjoyed preparing for an exam before. Also in the sidelines, his extensive preparations helped him in his college as well. He was consistently performing well in his subjects.

Finally in his third year after almost 12 months of preparation, he gave the exam. And then he painstakingly waited, for two more months for the results. He had always heard of IAS toppers and IIT toppers saying a phrase, "" I knew I would qualify, I never knew I would score this well"". This time he was the one who felt it. He had scored an AIR 14 in the Mathematical Statistics paper. He made it, he was finally going to IIT bombay.

Two more years of great college experience at IIT Bombay, numerous exams, cultural events and an interesting internship later he got placed in one of the biggest retail firms in the Middle East with a hefty package. He is infact moving to Kuwait in a week, about to start his first job. His parents couldn't be happier.

I guess by the personal tone of this story you might have guessed, the guy was me. I had the worst time of my life during the first year of my college. Failure hit me hard. I felt I had disappointed my parents. But now when I think of it, I guess that was for the best. I found out a subject I was passionate for. And I did my Masters in that subject. Even my job is in direct correlation with my area of interest. So you see maybe you need to find that passion for yourself. No college or course will benefit you until you are committed. I have seen people hating there subjects after engineering and taking up jobs in the IT sector despite of their choice of stream. 

Find something interesting, which makes you happy. If you are interested in coding, enroll in some online course. Learn all that is about a particular coding language. Or take up something else which interests you. I am not saying give up on your studies. But out of the courses you have, try to find something which is in tune with you. And once you find it, keep working on it. Who knows something great might just be around the corner. Maybe prepare for GATE and join the top IITs. Intern with startups. Just remember. Keep learning something throughout the four years of college. Do it for the experience. You might forget about the courses, the theorems and formulas. But you will always remember the experiences. 

And don't worry about your parents. They are just worried about you. Once you show them that you are happy and you are performing, they will come around. Believe me, things are never that bad. Sometimes riding it out is all you need to get out of the tunnel. It won't be easy, but you will feel better and stronger once its done.

There was once a group of tiny frogs, who decided to arrange a running competition. The goal was to reach the top of a hill as high as 1000 feet. A big crowd gathered around the hill to see the race and cheer on the participants.

And the race began...

No one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the peak of the hill. They started shouting, “Oh, way too difficult!!! They will NEVER make it to the top” and “Not a chance. It's not their cup of tea”.

And soon the tiny frogs began collapsing, one following the other except for those who, in a fresh tempo, were climbing higher and higher…

The crowd continued to yell, “It’s too difficult! No one will make it!”

More tiny frogs got exhausted and gave up but one continued higher and higher. This creature wouldn’t give up! And he reached the top.

Everyone wanted to know how this one frog managed such a great feat.

His secret?

The wisdom of this story is:
1. Whenever someone close to you come and tell you that you can't really do or accomplish a task, they talk to you but actually point toward their own inability or lack of knowledge to do that task. It's ""If I can't do it, nobody else can."" syndrome and you must give a hug to the diseased.

2. Ignore the pessimism of others. The more you listen to it, the less will you be able to stay focused.

But she had a different story. Let's see how it went..........
 
She: His in-hand salary might be 80k. Now we will rent a flat nearby Marine Drive or in Bandra and would cost us around 25k.(She had no idea about the prices but was trying to refute by making shit stories)
 
Both of us silent, she continued: We would own a car, daily groceries and other monthly expenses will cost us around 25k more. (This was her list of all the basic expenses like fuel, mobile phone etc)
We would be going to dine at some best places in Mumbai, would explore places nearby Mumbai and it will eat up another 10k. You know I am an adventurous girl.

I don't know if this counts as ""beautiful,"" but it seemed that way to me at the time.

One early afternoon, about 15 years ago, I was in the neighborhood of my son's elementary school, and decided to surprise him with a lunchtime visit.  I was told by his teacher that he was on the playground, and went out to find him. He was in the middle of a group of kids, and when he saw me, he ran over to say hi.  He had a small toy in his hands, like a Power Ranger model, that I didn't recognize.

""This isn't ours, is it?"" I asked.  He said he was just borrowing it from one of his friends, and he pointed toward the group he was with.  ""That one,"" he said.

I laughed because it could have been any of about dozen kids in the area he indicated.  He pointed sharply, ""That boy with the...blue shirt.""  That narrowed it down to about seven kids.  I shook my head to let him know that I didn't know who he was pointing to.  ""He has the red sneakers,"" which I don't think matched any of the blue shirted kids.  Finally, when he said ""There, daddy. The one who has the ball now,"" it finally dawned on me that he was pointing to the only black child in that area of the playground.  I stopped myself from blurting out, ""You mean the black kid?"" since I could tell that he genuinely didn't see this kid's skin color at all, and I didn't need to be the one to open his eyes to racial differences.

To this day, I don't understand how he was able to see the color of this child's shirt and sneakers, but not skin.  Maybe it's something we have to teach them to specifically recognize.  I really don't know.  But it somehow left me a little more heartened about the future.

Former President, top scientist, Bharat Ratna.... These are just some of the titles that come before the name of APJ Abdul Kalam who died today in Shillong, collapsing in the middle of what he loved doing most -- talking to students. In this case, the students of the Indian Institute of Management. He was 83.

Born 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu to humble parents - his father was a boat owner -- APJ Abdul Kalam distributed newspapers at one time to support his family and his education.

He graduated with physics from the Madras University, went on to study aerospace engineering, wanted to be a fighter pilot but just missed that bus.

But there was no stopping him. The DRDO, ISRO, chief scientific advisor to the prime minister in 1992, the Pokhran 2 nuclear tests... Abdul Kalam straddled them all, till he was elected India's 11th President in 2002.

It was the role he will probably be most remembered for --  a president who brought Rashtrapati Bhavan to the people.... earning him the tribute of the People's President.

Signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure -- that's what Abdul Kalam himself was once quoted saying.

There were also controversial decisions - his response to mercy petitions from death row convicts and the imposition of President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.

But what he will remembered for was his engagement with the people - especially children - even after his presidency and the books that he wrote - India 2020 and, of course, Igniting minds.   

""If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun,"" APJ Abdul Kalam had said in one of his inspirational speeches. He certainly did.

Today that sun has set."

 Balaji Viswanathan's Answer: (112.9k+ followers on Quora)

The problem is primarily with the student than with the parent. Rights come after you are ready to bear the responsibilities. It is easier to fix the problem in the self than fighting ""the system"".

Parents push their kids into certain career paths for a variety of reasons:
They love their kids a lot.
Their future is deeply tied with those of their kids.
They are very confused on what is the right path for their kids. It is easier to follow the trend.
They are very uncertain about how good their kids are.

Now, the solutions.
We don't want to change this.
If the student takes more financial responsibility by both voluntarily cutting down their expenses as well as earning part time it cuts the parents risk substantially. I'm not a good example for anything, but I refused to buy a motorcycle or any other luxury during student life until I could earn on my own. While my classmates buzzed in their new motorbikes, I had to settle for a sports cycle I got as a gift. In return, I got full freedom to control the important aspects of my life. If you want your parents to not follow parent fads, you need to stop following the students fads on the path to financial ruin [expensive foods, expensive vehicles, expensive gadgets]. It takes two to tango.
Parents are often confused about life. They don't know what is best out there. They think engineering is best because that is what they read out there. If you really think music is best for you, find good examples from people with your abilities and show them. Tell them that Sharmaji's son with same abilities as you are is now earning Rs. 2 crores after mastering music. Understand such stories in depth and see what they did on their path. Support that with good statistics. Trying to convince someone without data is stupid.
Know your own life. Don't get a degree because it ""looks cool"" or that your favorite actor in a movie did that. Be more proactive in understanding life and your various career paths. Be open and flexible. Inspire confidence. When you are confident & well informed, your parents are much more likely to give your way. People love to follow leaders.
Stop fighting the system. The problem sits right in front of your screen.

953,"Niharika Banerjee's answer to How do introverts enjoy life?
(A Top Writer on Quora)
.
.
.
There are some misconceptions people have about introverts :
We're shy.
We're bad at interviews.
We don't open up easily.
We don't have a life.
We are socially awkward.
However, normal signs of introverts are :
We enjoy solitude.
We like inviting just our best friends and closest family members to our gathering.
We like to have a conversation over a drink or a cup of coffee rather than being in a noisy pub where we cannot hear the voice of our friend sitting across the table.
We do not like making ""small talk"".
We often suck at ""keeping in touch"" because again, we suck at making small talks.
We do party, but again, with the best of our friends, and not otherwise.
How I, as an introvert, enjoy my life -
I go for long drives with my best friends, followed by dinner.
I stay home and read newspapers, or watch some nice movies or tv shows.
I chat with my parents.
I have some ""me time"" when I simply put on some music, give myself a foot massage, and just relax.
I'd love to travel with my best friends later on in life.
I clean up my house.
Clicking selfies, meeting people just for the heck of it and then clicking more selfies, and chatting endlessly to people, that's just not my thing. Some solitude, some real conversations - that's all I want for enjoyment."

I survived the serial train bomb blasts by 12 minutes. 

Mumbai, 11 July 2006, Tuesday. It was my first month of junior college. My classes ended at 5:30 pm. I came out with my group of friends. The day looked as normal as ever. We stopped by to have a glass of fresh lime, took the auto rickshaw to the train station.

I remember the auto driver arguing with me for spare change. I was determined to take my pennies back and didn't care if I missed my train. ""They come in every 2 minutes, let it go, I need to teach this auto-wala a lesson""  And so, I missed my usual train of 6:00pm. 

Rushed to the station, got the train, and reached Mahim at 6:10pm. Made my way through the rush, crossed the bridge, went to the other side, and exactly after 12 minutes, there was a noise loud enough to cut through your ear drums. It felt like an earth quake. I froze and sat in a corner, my ears covered with my hands and eyes shut while I could hear people screaming and crying. 

When I opened my eyes, I was in my bedroom with all my family members surrounding me and my mother kissing me, hugging me and crying all at the same time. Apparently I was spotted by a family friend and was taken home while I was unconscious.

For all I know, had I not missed my train, I wouldn't be alive. I dodged death by 12 minutes. 

I am grateful for this life and I am grateful for every minute I live.

959,"Q: I failed three years in IIT and betrayed my parents. Should I die ?

A: I feel you bro! 
But then, I also don't. Here's why. 

I joined for Civil Engineering in IITB in 1999. I was let go out of campus because of bad grades in 2006. The bad grades were due to numerous reasons, compounding failures in acads, mixed with some lost friendships and struggles at 1st love. 

I was also in denial, that ""Ghus gaye hain to nikal hi jayenge"", hadn't told my parents things were going bad, very bad, and one day the campus took the decision out of my hand. They mailed the termination notice to parents. 
I feel you till here. 

Why not more?
To be honest, I only had a semester worth of courses left. But I had  lost interest. I had recovered from most backlogs by doing only some at a  time, and mostly scoring DDs. 
I had hobbies. One of them was tinkering with Websites, making a page look right in all browsers was very crafty back then (pre-Bootstrap era and IE6!, tables-tables everywhere), and I was good at it. I also realized that due to backlogs, I had access to a network of 7+ batches. 

The only question was? Did I ever intend to work in Civil. Answer was no. I applied to startups in Campus, one of which was Webaroo. I told them about the situation, and the CTO said: ""Can you do pages?"", I said ""Yes"". 
""You know they need to work across all platforms"", I said ""Yes"". ""Then its Ok, we're not hiring you to design/create buildings anyway"".

So I never for once had suicidal tendencies. 

I joined in at 5LPA (most of my batchmates who had graduated in 2003, were making 6-7 at that time, so not bad. Understand that we'd just come out of 1st Internet bubble). 

Things were not so rosy at home. Parents knew nothing about Internet or UI development. They knew I was decent at computers, and were thinking of opening a Cyber/Gaming Cafe for me back then. This job gave them some sense of security, that I'm not total failure. 

8 years of hard work, constantly learning How internet works, and how its shaping our lives, and I left them as Principal Product Manager and started consulting and planning my final attempt to get in and clear things.  

Why did I go back?
""Because Death is lighter than a feather; Duty, heavier than a mountain"" -Robert Jordan

You put it nicely in your question, ""Betrayed your parents"". I felt I did the same, and it was my Duty to clear it. It simply had to be done. 

Financially, I am stable. I earn 20L+ easily per year. I have a 3BHK in Thane of which I'm paying out loans, but things are manageable. My job doesnt requires me to show/prove my degree.

I did it for my father. Everytime he'd go for a meetup where my qualification comes into question (matrimony, for example), his head would be down as he'd explain I'm only 12th pass on paper. Our society would also not let it rest and there'll be time and again talks like ""His son could not clear college.."". And no amount of personal success would take that pain away from him. 

He didn't ask me. IT HAD TO BE DONE. 

Process: 
I still wanted to finish. The 10 year reunion of my batch was coming. If using the nostalgia, I wasn't going to get in, then I should just call it quits and move on, it was like proposing to a girl who's not going to marry you anyway, no matter how many times you proposed. I had full plans of getting a petition done from my batchmates, social media strategy and what not. 

Thankfully I didnt need it. I dont know which IIT are you from, but IITB has something called ARP, which has been running for about 3 years now. ARP is Academic Rehabilitation Program. It allows for dropouts/kickouts like me to comeback via a Qualifying Semester. And current students who clear less then 18 credits in two consecutive semesters, are automatically put into it. Your load is reduced from 32+ credits to max 24, with a condition that plan for less, but plan better and clear it in one go. There are weekly counseling sessions and you have to maintain 100% attendance, and all of it helps. 

I was careful this time.  I was always on time, I ensured my notes were to date. And I'd finish assignments the same day they were given. I also knew this was once in a lifetime chance. And I was running a personal financial loss by earning half my salary for the entire year (Yes, I was working half time in SINE startups)

Result:
I managed to get AA in a course I've got FR thrice 10 years ago.  I have cleared all requirements and would be participating in convocation this year.

Remember:
1) You cleared JEE. If nothing else, that's your  confidence booster. You did it. It is arguably the most tough thing to  do at that age. There is no reason why you cant get a DD and clear  what's thrown at you. Plan for an AA, DD aa jayega. 
2) If you do not want to participate in core Job, degree doesnt hinder you much. It will, but not much. 
3) Do you have a talent, you can monetize that, ping me and we'll figure out. 
4) These days you can earn 80k a month driving a car, so there's no end to the world. 
5) IT jobs are still good option and easy to pick up. You can learn HTML/CSS/Jquery/Bootstrap in 4 months max and land a starting job of 6k.
6) If you are good at Art, you can learn Photoshop/Illustrator and can easily draw 1L per month by freelancing (PM me and we'll work it out)

Do:
0) Get the f*ing guilt out of your system. Its ok you lost 3 years. Say sorry to your parents, to your best friends, to yourself and make peace with it. No use crying over spilt or split milk. Get the negativity out of your system. 
1) Take a trip. Go out with friends. 
2) Avoid drinks, smoke and vices. 
3) They dont kid when they say that ""Healthy mind resides in a healthy body"" Get in shape. Cleanse your body. Shave. Take baths regularly. Clean your room and clean your bedsheets. Get a Haircut. Wear clean clothes. You'll feel better. I remember when I was depressed, I'd stop taking care of myself. I'd smell and my wingmates would not point it out because we were good friends and they had pity on me.  
4) Do something positive, even if its social service. Get a sense of usefulness in yourself.
5) Make yourself matter to someone by doing things, volunteer.
6) Acquire a skill, figure out how to monetize it, start paying for yourself. Adjust your expenses to meet your salary.
7) Start doing things, get confidence, then get back into the game (if game allows it)

Don't ever f*king think of suicide. 
If you don't like a game or are miserable at it, don't play it.  Switch your game, and play that. Suicide isnt an answer to anything. 

Death is lighter than a feather; duty, heavier than a mountain. 

PM me if you need any help, getting back in, or working towards getting a job, internship, volunteering or anything. 

It can be done.

So Virender Sehwag once played for the English county Leicestershire. Once he was batting with the no.8 batsman, Jeremy Snape. The bowler they were facing was Abdul Razzaq, who was bowling with the old ball. So naturally, he was reverse swinging the ball prodigiously, so much so that balls started on off stump, and tailed back into the batsman's boot. Razzaq had already accounted for two of their batsmen. They still had 40 overs left in the day, and with the way the ball was nipping around, it didn't seem likely that they would last the day.

Snape comes up to Sehwag and says - ""This guy's making a mockery out of us. I can hardly see the ball coming. You've got to do something.""

Sehwag bites his lip, toes the pitch and says - ""Okay. I've got a plan.""

So when Razzaq comes out to bowl the next ball, Sehwag takes two steps down the pitch and smacks the ball clean out of the stadium. The umpires look at each other, and order a change of ball.

Then Sehwag walks up to Snape and says : ""The new ball won't swing for some time. We are safe for another two hours.""

964,"Q: What is the strangest IIT JEE story?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
TLDR :  I forgot to sign my JEE application form in 2002. I would have been rejected. But I wasn't and my mom is superb.

I was quite absent minded and careless as a student when it came to completing administrative formalities. Filling up forms, submitting on time. I still make such mistakes like once I gave a cheque to someone without putting a date and it was returned.

Coming back to the point. I had to submit the IIT JEE screening test application on time. This was in December 2002 a few months before my board exams. I didn't attend a coaching institute and continued with my school in home town. In those days there was no pervasive internet, you relied on information coming through friends, you corresponded with posts for official tasks than internet, and 24x7 helpline was unheard of. I posted my form along with my friend at the speed post office. Both of us looked at the content and determined for what lay ahead of us. There was fear and the underdog feeling that we have been preparing on our own and do not stand a chance against students who have dedicated 2,3 or 4 years preparing for the exam. But we had high opinions of ourselves. We lived in a city named Pali in Rajasthan unknown to rest of India.

I returned home, and was napping, it was about 5 pm or so. Suddenly drama ensued. In my tender sleep I had a revelation. I DID NOT SIGN THE FORM.  Without my signature it was void. I wouldn't be able to even participate in the exam which can change the course of my life. And what will I do on the exam day when my mother will ask me about the day of the exam, why I am not attending. I had a million thoughts cross my mind in a matter of few minutes. My blood was cold. Even if I was not prepared for the exam, I was gutted.

Somehow I gathered the courage to tell my mother about my mistake and that is was ""all over"". I really felt it was over. But my mother was made of another material. She was and is a woman of action, of conviction. She took 5-10 minutes and declared, ""We will go to the post office and withdraw our letter and send it again"". While my mind was gripped with doubts and disbelief that it was possible, ""Why would they let us, can a letter be withdrawn, even if we withdraw, the last date is neigh I will still miss the deadline for application"", my mother quickly changed into clothes to go outside, shouted on me to get dressed. We walked another 2km to auto rickshaw stand, my mother was excited and determined. Me trying to keep pace heads down.

Next, up we reached the post office, told our situation. Whatever we say about the nature of human beings, the people in the post office were helpful and sympathetic. They didn't shoo us away. The post man did give me a disapproving look, he was sad to see my mother go through this. But to our shock, ""he couldn't do anything because the post was dispatched from the EMS center"".  Surely I thought ""It is all over, thanks for trying mummy but I screwed it, may be I signed it who knows"".

As I said, my mother is of another material. She demanded ""Where does the post go from here?"". The postman said ""There is a post office parcel center at the railway station, it can be there or on the train, you can try there"".

Another auto rickshaw, and now we were at the railway station. Took a while to find the post office parcel collection room. Reached there. It looked chaos. A large number of sacks. No office room. Three tables and people were moving around. ""What do we do?"". We approached a lady who seemed like in charge. We explained. They were puzzled. We explained again what JEE was and it was important. Again, more co-operation than turning us away. A search was ensued, but the sack for my post wasn't getting located.

One of those people who put the sack in the trains chipped in. ""The bag is already on the train which will depart in 15-20 minutes"".  They didn't say ""we can do nothing"". They said ""bring the damn bag"". The seal was broken, letter was brought out. We opened the envelope from the rear with a blade. Form was taken out. ""THE SIGNATURE WAS NOT MADE"".

Here comes the most important part. My mother opened her purse, and produced the same pen with which I had filled the form. ""Here use this. Signature should be in the same ink."" How she remembered to pack the pen before leaving and how she had the presence of mind to take it out if it was always with her, I do not know.  Sign made, paper work for the entire sack redone. The post master took the responsibility for us.

The IIT JEE screening exam took place in April. I had now gone to a ""crash course"" for 11 days in Jodhpur and dropped out. The teachers were crappy. Wrote the screening, and I qualified for the mains. I got a rank of 4300 in my first ever attempt at IIT JEE screening. I sat for the mains in May or June I think. My mother had the burden of now taking her stupid over achieving son to Jaipur. In other families this would have been easy. For a single mother of two children, not anything less than a nightmare. Plus the surrounding guilt that her son is under prepared because she doesn't have the resource. Luck ran me out. I failed the mains exam. I cried during the Chemistry paper. 60 years after independence, I couldn't find a single teacher in my entire town who could teach me basics of Chemistry for JEE. Who could tell me the name of a book. (I learnt Physics from HC Verma, the publisher copy I saw in my Physics tuition teachers house and borrowed from him. My Math teacher was super cool, he is super cool. He had books. I bought SL Loney in a book fair. My preparation was luck based.)

AIEEE was easier as it was on screening pattern. I came to NIT Jaipur in 2003. There was a pain of not qualifying for JEE, exacerbated by the fact that I now understood what being in IIT could have meant for my life. But I decided to get along with my engineering, the pain went away.

I have come a long long way from the quirky kid of 2002. Looking back, my life has changed. Clearing screening without preparation gave me the confidence that I can achieve anything in life. Clearing AIEEE got me through NIT and thus my career kick started.

But if I think about that incident. It taught me a more important lesson. A lesson my mother taught me. A mother who is both mother and father. Whatever be the situation, don't give up. If it is not over, it is not over. Do not call it over because you think it over. Push the limits, think through shake things, and you don't know what is possible.

Looking back at the post office employees too, none of them have had a change in their lives. They were in mid 30s or 40s. Now they are in 40s and 50s. Doing the same job each and everyday. Ensuring your and my letter goes on time. Their life didn't change by foregoing the process to allow me to sign my letter. We didn't have any identity card those days. Those were the days people trusted each other. They didn't ask for a single rupee, they didn't even made a mention of this. They just said ""If your son gets selected please get us some sweets and wished me good luck"".

I never really returned to my hometown after class 12. I didn't qualify the exam, but I am sure I don't remember the faces of those people. I am sure that they don't remember the incident at all. It has been many years and their life is the same. We never took the sweets to them. But I cannot forget their helping hand in this strange story that holds a lot of meaning for my life. And has a lesson for many of us.

India's daughter: Bilkis Bano

""All the 4 men of my family were killed brutally. The women were stripped naked and raped by many men. They caught me too. My 3-year old daughter, Saleha, was in my arms. They snatched her and threw her into the air with all their might. My heart broke as her little head shattered on the rocks. Four men caught me by the arms and legs and many others entered me one by one. When satisfying their lust, they kicked me and beat my head with a rod. Assuming that I was dead they threw me into the bushes.

Four or five hours later I regained my consciousness. I searched for some rags to cover my body, but couldn’t find any. I spent a day and a half on a hilltop without food or water. I longed for death. Finally I managed to find a tribal colony. Declaring myself as a Hindu I sought shelter there.

Those men were using such foul language, I can't repeat it ever. In front of me they killed my mother, sister and 12 other relatives. While raping and killing us, they were shouting sexual abuses. I could not even tell them that I was five months pregnant because their feet were on my mouth and neck.

The conviction and imprisonment of my rapists does not mean the end of hatred. But it does mean that somewhere justice can succeed. I have known the men who raped me for many years.

Mahima's Answer: 

Only yesterday, I had my first lecture in college. It was an introductory lesson and the whole class was interacting. I was rather quiet the whole time but then I finally spoke up and caught everyone's attention.

I'm in first year studying Journalism in Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi University. During the 'Introduction to Media and Communication' class, there was a heated discussion about the impact of media on people due to its widespread reach in the 21st century. When I spoke up, I mentioned that although media has a wider reach through online platforms, it is not necessarily creating an impact. On Facebook, a post could be selling trash and people would buy it without a second thought. But, in communities like Quora, they actually seek reference and validity of any information being given. People are more educated in the 21st century and the critical thinking has enabled us to analyse information before being impacted by the trash that media tries to sell us.

I did put forward a few examples too, but the moment I mentioned Quora, most of my class turned to look at me in awe and I could see a smile on my teacher's face too. That's how Quora creates a divide between the social media rants and intellectuals. Proud to be a Quoran! :D

969,"Q. If China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka attack India at the same time, how long will it take them to defeat India?
.
.
.
.
.
.

A. Look at it this way. If military strength is compared to a no holds barred fight, we have roughly a following distribution.

China is a professional boxer Lee. A world class one at that.

India is a street cop, Kumar. Can take care of street rats, but no match for the boxer when it comes to fight.

Pakistan is his 13 year old brother, Ali, aggressive, hot head, but untrained and fragile.

Sri Lanka is a 5 year old kid, Thiru.

Now, suppose, Ali, Lee and Thiru, all have decided to beat the shit out of Kumar, in a no holds barred street fight at Kumar's home. Who will Kumar worry the most about? But obviously, Lee.

Kumar quickly slaps Thiru and Ali, making way to save himself from Lee. Lee, however is a professional, he throws a solid punch at Kumar's face, Kumar ducks, but couldn't evade the second punch right into his ribs. Kumar starts bleeding. He throws a couple of hands at Lee himself, but Lee doesn't find it anything close to painful. Meanwhile, Ali, tries to get hold of Kumar, Kumar, lends a solid kick to Ali, fending him off for some time, but this gives ample opportunity to Lee to deliver another sucker punch.

Kumar clearly knows that he will be defeated by Lee. He knew it before the fight even began. But what are Lee's intentions? Is it beating down Kumar just enough, or to do some serious damage?

If it is beating down Kumar, then he is probably done. He will leave the fight, and Kumar will let go of his anger on Ali. Thiru is just a kid here, whom Kumar loves very much anyways, so after a couple of slaps, Thiru would just be crying beyond measure.

Now, suppose, that's not the case. Then, it's a no holds barred fight, remember. Lee keeps on taking Kumar's case. Kumar is adamant, he won't bow. In this mind numbing scenario, Kumar accidentally punches Thiru, and Thiru was badly bruised. Ali keeps on getting his share of mis delivered punches from Lee, and a couple of solid blows from Kumar.

Kumar knows, that if he ends up fighting with Lee, with punches, he will be crippled permanently. So, he knows he has a grenade. But then, Lee has a grenade too. Both of them warn each other of their own grenades. Ali says, I have a grenade too. Both Kumar and Lee share a laugh. Ali says, I am damn serious. Both of them know, grenades are only to be used in situation of desperation, as they would both die, if it comes down to them, but have no faith whatsoever in Ali. Lee increases his unintentional blows to Ali. Things get ugly, the fight between Lee and Kumar becomes seriously bloody, but hasn't yet come down to the bombs.

Now, there are 3 neighbors down the next lane, USA as Andy, UK as Wilson and Russia as Vladimir. Andy is the MMA world champion. He hates Lee and has an on and off relationship with Ali. Andy, although he is the best in the world, shows off his power by beating and looting random 10 year olds like Iraq and Afghanistan, and uses them to practice actual fight. So, he is feared, seriously.

Wilson and Vlad are both WWE wrestlers, plenty of show off, but not really in a mood of real fight.

They all are seriously pissed off with Lee, for stealing all their business.

Now, when they realize that with Kumar beaten up, Lee will be ruling a full corner of the neighborhood, they realize that this would make Lee a grave danger to themselves and their livelihood. They also know that Lee, ultimately aims to take over the full area. They also know that if it comes down to bombs, the whole neighborhood is destroyed.

So, Andy threatens Lee to stay away from Kumar. Lee, says ""Bullshit"". Vlad and Wilson will keep on delivering Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson style lines, but will wait for Andy to do anything. Andy delivers couple of warnings more to Lee who in turn delivers another couple of punches to Kumar, and Andy says it's enough. Kumar is seriously bleeding now, and is seriously contemplating taken Lee down with himself using bombs, before Lee does some permanent damage to him. Andy knows this, and Lee knows this, but Lee wants to extract some more. Andy sees, it's enough.

Ali, meanwhile knows he can't take on Andy, says sorry to Andy, and sits like a good boy at home, leaving Kumar and his home. Andy even gives him money for an ice cream. Thiru, has gone missing in all this. May be, he would be found sometime later.

Andy steps in, delivers 3 solid kicks to Lee. Lee starts bleeding now. He knows that things have gone out of hand. Depending upon his mood, he will either step back, still swearing at Kumar, or if he has grown really powerful, take a stone and throw it at Andy's house.

This seriously infuriates Andy, who is now going to beat the shit out of Lee. He punches and kicks and punches and kicks Lee. Fighting moves to Lee's home. Lee, threatens Andy now, that he has got the bomb. Andy replies, ""You have got bombs? I have got 100 times bigger bombs than you do."" (which is by the way completely true). Lee is afraid. Wilson and Vlad join in, deliver a couple of punches to Lee, who is strangled by Andy.

Lee knows that this is seriously getting out of his hand now. He calls for help. But everybody hates him. Nobody comes. His own brother, Lama (Tibet), who is merely a 10 year old kid, whom he used to bully, comes to join the party and deliver two inconsequential blows to Lee.

Lee quickly changes stance, and makes peace with Andy. He gives all the money he made from Andy's customers back to Andy. Wilson and Vlad demand a share from Andy. Andy is like ""Seriously?"". They both shut up. Lee is bruised enough not to take on Kumar again. Kumar is bruised enough not to take on him again. Lee takes out his wrath on Lama. Seriously.

Kumar's and Lee's houses as well as bodies are a shitty mess. One fourth of Kumar's house needs to be rebuilt, but he still owns the property. Ali never had a house, and has taken some serious damage. Thiru is still missing. Another kid, Gorkha (Nepal) has gone missing.

Meanwhile, in the next lane, Kawasaki (Japan) and Pufendorf (Germany) are celebrating Christmas in July, with Lee and Kumar out of business."""
970,"Q: Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone?
.

.
.
A: As said by Markandeya Katju:

""When I was Chief Justice of Madras High Court, I went with my wife to Rameshwaram. After going to the temple there I decided to go to the family residence of Dr. Kalam. I was received there by his elder brother and his family. The family house is a small simple house, with no trappings of luxury or ostentation. It was just like a simple hut. I wondered that had this house belonged to many of our present politicians that house may have by now become a palace.

When Dr. Kalaam became the President of India he gave strict instructions that if any of his family members ( he himself is a bachelor, but his brothers, only one of whom has survived, and sisters have children and grandchildren) came to Delhi to stay with him in Rashtrapati Bhawan he would himself pay for their travel fare and even their food, etc in Rashtrapati Bhawan, as they were his private guests, not official guests.
I wonder how many Presidents have maintained those high standards.
This is why Dr. Kalaam is loved so much by Indians even today"".

986,"8 Reasons Why Life at SRCC Stands Out From the Rest

1. Crossroads: The first thing that pops into the head of an SR-ite if you ask them what they love the most about their college is “Crossroads”, the sacred name of their annual cultural fest. There is no doubt that it is the best college fest in New Delhi, headlined by some of the biggest artists in the country and a massive turnout consisting of thousands of students from other colleges as well.

2. Emphasis on Extracurricular Activity Like Nowhere Else:
     SRCC boasts of about 20 societies that are active throughout the year, involved in various fields of extracurricular activity. From Street Theatre to Dance to Music, the SRCC campus has it all to add that extra charm to the environment inside.

3.  One of the Most Beautiful Campuses in India:
Located in the coveted North Campus of Delhi University, SRCC is characterized of an extremely beautiful campus which students, on entering find it really difficult to leave. The campus is filled with evergreen lawns, with trees of different hues providing for a much needed relief from the scorching sun during summers. The campus also has a sufficient share of hangout zones, such as Irfaans, under the shadow of Gulmohar trees and the cooperative store area, informally known as the Co-op. Whether you’re chilling with friends, photocopying notes at the Crystal Xerox Shop, or listening to people jamming to songs on their guitars, Co-op is the place to be.

4. International Exposure:
Being regarded as the best commerce college in India and one of the best colleges in the country as well, SRCC is also highly appraised for its international exposure. Myriad foreign exchange programs with tie-ups with many internationally renowned universities are organized all throughout the year, allowing students to expand their knowledge and skills.

5. The Best Faculty for Higher Studies in Commerce and Economics in India:

Since the college offers only two honours courses(Com (Hons) and B.A.(Hons) Economics   it means that the institution specializes in what it provides. The college boasts of a top class faculty, comprising friendly, understanding and knowledgeable professors, with the majority of professors being authors of national best-selling textbooks.

6. Top-class Placements:
Job placements and internship opportunities are plentiful at SRCC. The Placement Cell is very active, roping in a wide range of companies related to finance, marketing, human resources and other fields to be a part of the placement process. (Highest package so far 39 Lakh Rupees at undergrad level)

7. Multi-dimensional Social Atmosphere:
SRCC is an impressive melting pot of bright students from various cross-sections of society and regions. Students from different parts of the country as well as the worlds, different religions, languages and customs study together and there is a high degree of understanding and success without any kind of biasness. The social atmosphere is very student friendly with just the right mix of studies and partying.

8. An Alumni Worth Boasting:
When you’re college has a glorious alumni, consisting of the likes of Arun Jaitley. Lieutenant General Rajan Bakhshi, Rajat sharma, Anshuman Jain, there is very little that needs to be said to prove that SRCC is right there at the top.

987,"You see a beautiful girl on your first day in college and ....... No you don't want this to happen to you.  😭😭 😡😡

As any fresher, my mind was bubbling with many questions. How tough will be the studies, How strict will be IIT professors, Who will be my batch-mates ....

But the most frequent and most puzzling question was; how many and how beautiful girls will be in my class.

In IIT, girls to boys ratio was very bad. In our batch of around 500 we had only about 50 girls. With this statistic we roommates discussed the possibility to have a beautiful girl in our class. With very good control over probability we easily calculated very rare chances of this favorable outcome but human mind always try to rationalize and hope for the positive outcome, no matter how impossible the outcome is.

With crossed fingers, with hope for favorable outcome I started the journey for my first class in IIT. There was a clear instruction from seniors, not to use lift but use only stairs. My class was on 4th floor. We gathered near the lift and discussed should we use stairs or lift.

Some of us feel that climbing 4 floors is itself a punishment and used lift and others thought it is not worth to take risk and used stairs. I was in the lazy & risky group and choose the lift.

In the lift, there was a very beautiful girl; she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. When I saw her, I began to pray she should be in my class. With the fear that she may be a senior, I just had a few glimpse of her cute face. 
Both of us got out of lift on 4th floor. I got some hope. 

We started walking toward the classes and I was just few steps behind her. 
Then she entered a room. I checked the room number and it was the same room where my first class was planned. I got so excited and I was like

Wow she is in my class.
She is in my class.
She is in my class.

After controlling my excitement I entered the room. What I saw in the room I didn't believe.

She was standing next to black board and taking attendance of the students. At that moment all my hopes broke down. She was a PHD student and Teaching Assistant.

You look around and wonder more by finding your classmates are struggling to copy slides before the professor changes them. You console yourself that may be this professor is idiot but others would be good.

992,"Question: What is it like to be on the sets of Comedy Nights with Kapil?

Answer:

The answer is long, but it accounts for most which happened at the studio.

It was a great experience. You get to see a lot of bloopers and yes the reality.

Yes. The girls behind Siddhu's seat are models. Not some random audience. :D

I got this wonderful opportunity to visit the live shoot of Comedy Nights with Kapil. The guest stars were Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh Ram-leela promotion.

Audiences are asked to come 3-4 hour before the start of the shoot. Now, divide the audience into the left most, central and the right most. Director asks the leftmost audience to dance with full energy to the song they play. The top 3 arbitrary and funny dancers will be selected from this left most section. Same follows for the central and right most section. From this total 9, better 4-5 are refined and taught better to dance/act funny. We only see 1-2 funny dancers out of these on the TV. Rest is edited.

Now, the question-answer rounds. We can safely assume there are 4-5 questions per episode. However, on the actual shoot, there are 13-14 questions asked. Rest are edited depending upon the entertainment value.

Only these selected 13-14 can ask questions

How are the audiences selected?
Of the 13-14 questioners, 2-3 are pre-decided and are not from the audience. We will continue on how the rest 10-12 are selected? To the audience, director asks who is the biggest fan of the guest starrers. Many hands go up. Then he asks some intrigued questions about the stars. Few hands remain up. Then the warning, questioners should be ready to take insults on National TV. This time, you will find 20-25 hands still raised.

These 20-25(questioner+dancer/singer selection) are taken back stage for auditions. The show-crew already has the questions prepared. They just select the apt people for their questions. For e.g., If they have a question on love, romance, etc. a young boy/girl will be asked to ask to opposite sex guest star.

A guy in audience, who was not in the ''script'', asked a question. He was immediately kicked out of the studio for not following instructions. This should have been done, because, imagine all the 300-400 audience asking questions out of the ''script''. It will be a chaos and unnecessary time waste.

Leaving aside few(which are indeed good!) impromptus by Kapil Sharma on audiences name and profession, REST EVERYTHING IS SCRIPTED. Everything is timed. They have a prompter placed beside the band. Actors on-stage frequently refer to it for dialogues.

However, they are providing wholesome entertainment and nothing else should matter.

Some of the impromptu by Kapil Sharma do fall flat. They are edited. However, all the actors are great on-stage. Most of the scenes are one-take shots. This takes a lot of talent. 

There are rumours that Sunil Grover has left the show. There was no Gutthi, the time when I saw the shoot. Wish the rumours are wrong. 

No, I didn't get chance to meet any of the actors. Actors immediately disperse after the shoot. Audiences are held back during this dispersal.

Edit: Many people are curious about how I got the passes. My sister's friend's father's friend(Phew!) works for this show. He gave the passes.

993,"I am one of those guys who never gawk at women. In fact, I am so discrete most of the times that my previous two girlfriends actually pointed the 'fact' out that I don't check out girls.

Honestly speaking, I do check out women.

I'll tell you about something that happened a couple of days ago.

I was travelling in the Delhi metro alone. 
Now most of the times when I'm alone, I immerse myself in music. This time was an exception and I just stood there observing people around me.

There was this girl standing not more than 10 feet away from me. She was one of the most beautiful people I've ever laid eyes upon. I couldn't tell much about how she was as a person (obvious), but she was physically attractive and possessed a bewitching personality.

I definitely checked her out.

What I didn't do was:

Gawk at her with my mouth wide open, making her and/or other people around uncomfortable.
Change my position to go stand near her.
Invade her privacy in any way.
Make any obscene gesture to render her (and me) embarassed.
When she got down a couple of stations before me, I didn't follow her going off my own route.

In fact, I pen down all of the above things just because I'm answering a question and trying to make my point.
In that moment, I didn't think to myself ""I shouldn't go and stand near her. That would be wrong"" or ""I shouldn't stare at her like an animal.""

In that moment, it was all instinctive. I couldn't fathom invading her privacy.

It's been 48 hours since that incident and I'm positive I won't be able to recognize her if we happen to meet sometime in the future.

Checking out and ogling at someone are two different things.

Similarly,

Checking out and objectifying women are two different things as well.

I don't get attracted towards just the physical aspects of a stranger. 

Sometimes, I see a girl reading a book in the metro and I instantly separate her from the rest. (especially if it's a book I like)
Sometimes, someone's attire is what sets her apart from the rest of the group for me.
It's not always the physical aspects of a girl that grab my attention. 

There is absolutely no problem in 'checking' people out. Eveyone should just know their boundaries.

The two golden rules for checking out are:

Don't invade someone's privacy.
Don't make them feel uncomfortable.

I personally wouldn't mind if I catch a person looking at me, as long as they don't make me feel violated.

Same should be the case with women. If you expect me to look down at my shoes everytime a woman passes in front of me, then that's not gonna happen.
Call it patriarchy, call it misogyny, call it anti-feminism, call it anything you want.
I will observe people when in a public sphere and it would include the occasional thought to myself, ""Hey, that girl was really attractive.""

I don't find anything wrong with it, morally or legally."

996,"Q: What are the most inspirational success stories ever around the world?

Nishant's Answer:

There was this very poor guy of 16 years whose dad passed away when he was 5..
He had a family of 5 sisters, one non working mother and one elder non working brother. He joined Indian Navy to help his family financially, right after completing his schooling.

But it wasn't turning out to be enough. Therefore, he chose diving inside Navy for which they are paid extra with ration supply and everything.
Now to clear the physical exam to be a diver, there was a batch of 16 cadets out of which only 3 had to be selected. He was defeated in the swimming category itself by this other guy who was a baniya. He was to go back home the next day, expelled.

That evening in the mess, the baniya walked upto him and said, ""Tu aheer hai? Aur jaat bhi? Lagta nhi hai beta! haar gaya na baaniye se!!"" (You don't seem of the warrior caste, I defeated u so easily!) He didn't comment then, just packed his bags and left the other day.

The next selection was after 6 months. In this time, all he did was train himself to become a stone physically. Running for over 20 kms every morning and evening, diving off random and unsafe cliffs, once was even arrested for jumping in high tide in the Arabian Sea for practicing!

6 months later, he gave the physical exam and cleared it. Then came the competition in which he not only stood first, but also set a record for Indian Navy in deep sea diving! He stood first and cleared the exam.

2 months after that, he was the chief instructor of that same baniya guy who had insulted him and now he was his senior in the Navy!

Today he holds international deep sea water clearance of 400 mts and topped the Deep sea diver medic exam of UK beating contestants from 162 countries and made India proud.

He is my dad. :')

The nature of the citizens of the state.

Groceries and flowers collected by the shopkeepers from nearby forests are kept on display with the rates and a money box. The astonishing thing being that there is no shopkeeper around the shop.

If you want to buy some vegetable, it's as simple as weighing it and paying the amount according to the rate, and that's it. Pick up the balance from the money box and continue with your daily routine.

""We trust them, they have never failed us,"" say the shop owners. 
""We often buy from such shops. We feel great that Mizoram has such kind of vendors. We believe this should be the real practice"" say the buyer.Sometimes the shopkeepers don't earn much but feel happy about the trust in their customers.

Amritha's Answer: 

Here is the story of a woman who wrote her own destiny.

Born into a so called low caste dalit family She was not allowed to attend many school functions/activities, was bullied at school, parents of her friends refused to let her enter their homes. Married off at a tender age of 12 to a man 10 years older than her.  She moved with him to one of the slums in Mumbai. All that the marriage brought her was physical abuse and unspeakable torture. She was cruelly beaten by her 'husband's' elder brother and his wife. 

Her father finally found out the kind of life his daughter was living and brought her back to their own village. The society pushed her back for not leading the life as a  disciplined indian wife but coming back to her parents place. All the comments thrown at her about her failed marriage drove her to suicide, she drank bottles of pesticides to end her life. But, was fortunately saved.
That's when she decided to live and started dreaming big. There began the journey of a strong willed women. 

She wanted to pursue her studies but failed. 
She moved to Mumbai again dreaming of finding a job but failed.

As they say self help is the best help.  She learned stitching from mother and set up her own business. This is where her short sweet success began. 

She worked tirelessly for 16 hours a day and learned about industrial sewing machines available. Finally her business grew and she saw good profit. She got a government loan of 50,000 rupees and opened her own boutique. 

Her reputation made heads turn and she was asked to take over a company which was dying of debts. She brought Kamani Tubes for 2.5 crore. Now,  it is a growing business, worth more than $100m. Today she employs hundreds of people, from all backgrounds and castes and gives them life. 

She does not hold a MBA from Harvard or Yale. But she is at the helm of a successful company, she rubs shoulders with prominent businessmen and has won awards for her professionalism.

1006,"What are some common forms of sexism that men face?


Few years ago, while I was unmarried and was looking for a suitable match I registered myself on matrimonial sites (shaadi dot com and bharat matrimony) with a hope to get a similar minded person and a zero-showoff marriage. Also, my parents were looking for a suitable match via their personal & social connections.

A lot of phone conversations with prospects from the matrimonial sites used to consist of the following things...
It used to get clear in the very first few minutes of the conversation that the very reason why both of us chose to find a match via online matchmaking services was because we were looking for Open Minded, Educated, and Zero-Showoff, Dowry-Free marriage. And I used to get very happy that I am talking to such a modern person.
In the next few minutes details were exchanges. Details related to family, education, professional, misc details about friends and extended families. And till far, the discussion used to be a breeze.
One of the next topics used to be - Career plans after marriage. And I happily used to say that - It will be your choice, I will not interfere in your decision.
On the dowry issue, there was of course an agreement that I will not ask for dowry in any form.
So next I used to ask - So if things work out, when can you get married? The answer used to range from 3 months to a year. Which was absolutely fine.
At this point, almost all the girls I spoke to started taking discussing about the marriage planning, and the discussion used to go like this...
She: So where do you think we should get married?
Me: Either my town or your hometown or a neutral place.

She: I think it would be better if we go for your home town.
Me: Why So?

She: It would be easier for you to make the arrangements, hotel, reception, decorations, etc.
Me: But I thought we are going for a zero-showoff marriage. And I have already decided that I would go for court-marriage, followed by a small reception. And the entire event will be open only to extremely close members of the family and friends (not exceeding 20-25 people from each side).

She: Hmm....that sounds good, but don't you think its too simple shaadi? India mein aisa hota hai kya?
Me: Hota to nahin hai, but we are the ones who need to change things and start such good trends.

She: Ok, and how about jewellery and all?
Me: Whatever you wish you can buy, why would I have any issues with your jewellery. In any case you are one who is going to use it.

She: So, whats your budget?
Me: Budget for what?

She: Jewellery and other gifts which a bride gets from the groom's family.
Me: I thought we are going for a dowry-free marriage?

She: Yeah, but this is Indian custom. Groom's family has to gift jewellery items.
Me: *silence in shock*

{and at this point I had already made up mind, but then thought of testing my patience for a few minutes}

Me: Ok, fine. Agreed. So, lets do it this way. The marriage will be in your hometown. Baarat will consist of around 200 people. Make the arrangements in a good hotel. The marriage arrangements should be taken care by your family. All these expenses will be split between yours and my family. And I guess the expenses would be around 20Lac each side.
She: But thats not possible. Its dowry!

*Totally pissed by now*

Me : So girl, if you have to spend anything its dowry, and if we need to spend something it comes under the purview of Indian Customs! How fair is that?

She: *Hangs Up The Phone*


Its a real story. And I have tried speaking to almost 10-12 girls while I was looking for a suitable match.

Its painful how girls find it absolutely ridiculous to give any dowry (which is great), but then expect a modified form of dowry in return from the groom's family.

1007,"Q: What shocking things do most Indians not know?

Ashish's Answer:

Manmohan Singh came as SHAKTIMAAN by Saving India from 1991 Crisis:

                      INDIA would have been a GREECE at that time !!!
 But even Greece has Europe for support.What do we have...... Pakistan ? China ? or Bhutan ?

(To be clear before answering, I am not a 'Congress Fan'. I hate it equally as everyone ! )  Many Indians blame Manmohan Singh for being an incapable and silent PM. This might be true to some extent considering the poor performance of Congress, but what 'miracle' he did in 1991 is not much spoken anywhere.
To start let us go back to 1991.....
1991 Crisis:
              In 1991, India was on the verge of a drastic economic crisis. Our foreign reserve dipped to just $1 Billion. ( To put in simple words, that meant reserves to get imports for next two weeks only !) Had our foreign reserves dried completely, there would not have been Petrol in the tanks !
Transportation and economy would have shut completely, leading to a 'chain reaction' of our economic breakdown.
India was NOT 'creditworthy' in International Market !
INDIA would have been a GREECE at that time !!!
 But even Greece has Europe for support.What do we have...... Pakistan ? China ? or Bhutan ?
But then...

Manmohan Singh came as SHAKTIMAAN !
Thanks to Narsimha Rao, Manmohan Singh was appointed as our Finance Minister. That was the turning point of our economy.
As seen in hindi cinemas..... ME TUMHE MERE SONE KE GEHNE BECHKE BADA KARUNGI ( A typical dialoge in old hindi cinemas. which means, 'I will nurture you by selling my Golden Ornaments'), our Government (Chandrashekhar's Governnent) had sold tonnes of Gold (which was recovered later with our growing income), in return of foreign help.

ManMohanSingh not only implemented immediate measures, but also gave a full-stop to the license raj in India, where everything needed a license. Be it import, or business ...License was needed before. Removal of this, along with liberalization in foreign as well as domestic trade , increased the productivity of INDIA... !

Our economy shed its laziness suddenly, growth rate increased, INDIA got back its reputation in International Market... INDIA was saved from a big Crisis !

THANK YOU SHAKTIMAAN !!

1008,"Question: Do arranged marriages in India really work?

Anonymous's Answer:

This is my first answer on Quora and probably my last.

I was born and brought up in Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal. I had just completed my B.Sc from Agra when my parents decided to get me married. I was okay with  it, since I had lost 2 years after my 12th standard in pursuit of getting a  medical seat. I had to reject the first two suitors because of various  reasons. The third rejected me because he thought I was too short for  him. The fourth was the best. He worked in Bangalore, was from Allahabad  and hailed from a good family. He was too busy with his work, so we met on Skype for the first time. We liked each other. 

But  there was one big problem: I had to tell my decision right after the  chat. I asked for time and I got one full night to decide. Ironic isn't  it: you just get 8 hours to decide your future life partner, whereas  you get 2 full years just to try for an entrance exam?

My  gut said that he was good. I had just read Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist then, so I thought the  less time available was a good omen and was directing me to take the  right decision. I agreed. Both families discussed and our engagement was  set in Allahabad, one month later. He used to call me regularly during  this period. We both got involved in each others lives. On the E day, I met  him for the first time and damn!, he was taller than his parents  mentioned. But he looked like a movie star. I fell in love with him that  instant! Alas, he had to go back the same night. :-(

Our  marriage was fixed four months later, on Septrmber 12th. His calls were  increasing, I just loved it. I also got to know of  his severe alcohol  problem! But he promised he'd quit after marriage, so it was fine. But,  suddenly in the middle of July he started avoiding me  really bad. He used to switch off his phone, cut my calls and never reply  on WhatsApp. I got tensed. I wanted to inform his parents, but was too  scared.

I get a text at 3 a.m. on July 29th. The text was this:

""Are you a Virgin?""

I really did not know where that came from, but I was scared. However, I gathered my courage and replied, ""Yes, but what happened? Why were you avoiding me? Has anybody told anything against me?""

He  did not reply. He started picking my calls, but never spoke  wholeheartedly. Even upon repeated questioning, he never told me the reason  for his behaviour. I was really depressed and worried.

By then, my parents had already spent so much for marriage, so I didn't want to do anything that would hurt them.

Finally we got married. And he was gloomy throughout the occasion.

As  per our tradition, the bride should go to the groom's place after the  marriage. We went to their house. The bed in our room was really  decorated, like the one you see in movies. Finally we got to bed around midnight. He did not talk. I was shy too. I do not know if it's appropriate  to mention here, but I craved for physical intimacy that particular  moment. 

I  asked the reason for his weird behaviour. He didn't speak a word.  Suddenly he started crying loudly. He said he had committed some grave  mistakes. I told him that we could solve it together. He mentioned that he needed a favour but he would ask for it after going to Bangalore. 

We left for Bangalore on September 20th. All these days, we never had sex. 

Finally, I was told that he had bet huge sums of money on football matches  after getting drunk.  The amount was around 35 lakh rupees. That is a really  huge amount, even for both our families put together. But then, the next thing he told,  was the worst thing I had ever heard in my life. He had bet my  virginity.

He  had bet my virginity against 2 lakh rupees! I did not understand, I did  not want to believe. He said that there was a guy, named Aamir and he  just wanted me to sleep with him and lose my virginity to him. I was  devastated.

I did not know anything. I wanted to go back home and cry. But then, family, my sister, everything came to my mind. 

But, have sex with a stranger, because my fiancé thought he owns me? NO.
I told him that I wouldn't have sex with a stranger whatsoever. He told me that he would try to sort the matter out. 

I  was completely broken. My first day in Bangalore gave me the worst news  of my life. I just cried and slept. Two  people arrived in at the evening. I was under my blanket. Suddenly I felt someone entering. Then a  guy put in his hands in my blanket. I shouted loud. They got a bit  scared I guess. Those people were having an argument with my husband. I don't remember a single word of it, but they finally left after 20  minutes. I was still in a state of shock, holding the room door closed tightly.  I never let my so-called husband in that night.

I  called my parents and told them everything at 3 a.m. They contacted one of  our relatives in Chennai who came the next morning, picked me up and  took me to their place. I stayed there for 5 days and now I'm back to Agra. We  have  filed a police complaint, formally filed for a divorce and I have  still not recovered from my Bangalore horror.

I  know I am generalizing, but please beware of alcoholics. He had every  other quality right, but people make stupid decisions under the  influence of alcohol which might sabotage the life of someone else.

What wrong had I done? Even though we were poor, I grew up with respect. My father spent almost 70 percent of his savings on my marriage. Now, lawyer fees and other expenses. What wrong had I done?

I might be considered as a 'witch' now. Why? I don't know. Other people and  the police say that I am doing this for his salary. Would I risk the  respect of my parents, my sisters marriage and my entire life for a  software engineer's half salary?
Edit - Thanks a lot everyone for the comments, I feel stronger than before. Writing this answer has helped me a lot. I really do not how to repay you.

I would like to make these things clear:
I am not blaming Software engineers, even I want to be a Software Engineer.
Yes, I am blaming alcohol. I come from a lower middle class family and I have seen the ill effects of alcohol.

1009,"Based on True Story!

There were about 70 scientists working on a very hectic project. All of them were really frustrated due to the pressure of work and the demands of their boss but everyone was loyal to him and did not think of quitting the job. 

One day, one scientist came to his boss and told him – Sir, I have promised to my children that I will take them to the exhibition going on in our township. So I want to leave the office at 5 30 pm. His boss replied “OK, You’re permitted to leave the office early today”. The Scientist started working. He continued his work after lunch. As usual he got involved to such an extent that he looked at his watch when he felt he was close to completion. The time was 8.30 PM. 

Suddenly he remembered of the promise he had given to his children. He looked for his boss, He was not there. Having told him in the morning itself, he closed everything and left for home. Deep within himself, he was feeling guilty for having disappointed his children. He reached home. Children were not there. His wife alone was sitting in the hall and reading magazines. The situation was explosive, any talk would boomerang on him. His wife asked him “Would you like to have coffee or shall I straight away serve dinner if you are hungry."" The man replied “If you would like to have coffee, I
too will have but what about Children ??” .Wife replied “You don’t know?? , Your manager came here at 5.15 PM and has taken the children to the exhibition “.

What had really happened was …. The boss who granted him permission was observing him working seriously at 5.00 PM. He thought to himself, this person will not leave the work, but if he has
promised his children they should enjoy the visit to exhibition. So he took the lead in taking them to exhibition. The boss does not have to do it every time but once it is done, loyalty is established. That is why all the scientists at Thumba continued to work under their boss even though the stress was tremendous.

By the way, can you guess who the boss was ?"

One night when the whole world was sleeping, a thief broke into the house of a washer man.
The washer man was fast asleep but the donkey and the dog were awake.
The dog decided not to bark since the master did not take good care of him and wanted to teach him a lesson.
The donkey got worried and said to the dog that if he doesn't bark, the donkey will have to do something himself.
The dog did not change his mind and the donkey started braying loudly.
Hearing the donkey bray, the thief ran away, the master woke up and started beating the donkey for braying in the middle of the night for no reason.
Moral of the story: One must not engage in duties other than his own.

Now take a new look at the same story.
The washer man was like a typical top management corporate guy.
He had the fundas of looking at the bigger picture and thinking out of the box.
He was convinced that there must be some reason for the donkey to bray in the night.
He walked outside a little and did some fact finding, applied a research approach, figured out from the ground realities that there was a thief who broke in and the donkey only wanted to alert him about it.
Looking at the donkey's extra initiative and going beyond the call of the duty, he rewarded him with lot of hay and other perks and the donkey became his favorite pet.
The dog's life didn't change much, except that now the donkey was more motivated in doing the dogs duties as well.
In the Appraisal the dog managed an ""8"".
The donkey was rated as ""9"".
Soon the dog realized that the donkey is taking care of his duties and he can enjoy his life sleeping and lazing around.
The donkey had to live up to his already high performance standards.
Soon he was over burdened with work and always under pressure and now is looking for a switch....

After a while, he needed to pull the white screen down for a Power Point presentation he had to give. But as you all know, these screens are hard to keep in place once you pull them down and when SKY pulled it down and left it, it went hurtling back up. Since it was extremely close to the tube-light, it hit the tube-light as it rolled back, thus causing the tube-light to fall off and a loud noise accompanying it.

1031,"Every Indian Must Read This!!

Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala, 1973.

This case is now known as the case that saved the Indian democracy. On April 24, 1973, Chief Justice Sikri and 12 judges of the Supreme Court assembled to deliver the most important judgment in its history.

The hard work that had gone into the preparation of this case was breathtaking. Literally hundreds of cases had been cited and the then Attorney-General had made a comparative chart analyzing the provisions of the Constitutions of 71 different countries.

All this effort was to answer just one main question: “was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited?” In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights?

The judgment revealed a sharply divided court and, by a wafer-thin majority of 7-6, it was held that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend “the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution.

If the majority of the Supreme Court had held (as six judges indeed did) that Parliament could alter any part of the Constitution, India would most certainly have degenerated into a totalitarian State or had one-party rule. At any rate, the Constitution would have lost its supremacy.

One has to only examine the amendments that were made during the Emergency. The 39th Amendment prohibited any challenge to the election of the President, Vice-President, Speaker and Prime Minister, irrespective of the electoral malpractice. This was a clear attempt to nullify the adverse Allahabad High Court ruling against Indira Gandhi. The 41st Amendment prohibited any case, civil or criminal, being filed against the President, Vice-President, Prime Minister or the Governors, not only during their term of office but forever. Thus, if a person was a governor for just one day, he acquired immunity from any legal proceedings for life. If Parliament were indeed supreme, these shocking amendments would have become part of the Constitution.

Thanks to Kesavananda Bharati, Palkhivala and the seven judges who were in the majority, India continues to be the world’s largest democracy. The souls of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Patel and all the founding fathers of our Constitution can really rest in peace."
1032,"I would like to share a small incident:

I was traveling in a really crowded city bus in Pune (India). Fortunately, I had a seat. All the city buses in Pune have 50% seats reserved for women. The left side of the bus (which is reserved for women) was completely occupied (by women of course). The bus approached the SNDT Women's College stop (Karve Road) and few girls got in. I noticed that one of girls was carrying a huge bag and she couldn't even stand properly. Since, I was traveling light I offered her my seat.
She stared weirdly at me for a moment and shouted, ""Kay re? Line marto ka majhyavar?"" [Translation: Kyun re? Line maar raha hai kya? (Are you hitting on me?)]
I was a bit embarrassed and replied politely, ""No. I saw your huge bag and that's why I offered you the seat.""
By then the other passengers had started staring at me and giving dirty looks.
She shouted back, ""Don't try to act smart. I know what you meant.""
A few other female passengers (who were sitting) shouted something like, ""Aren't you ashamed of yourself?""
Then the girl slapped me! I WAS SLAPPED FOR OFFERING THE GIRL A SEAT!
I just can't express how embarrassing that was. I wanted to argue back, but I knew that, with the female passengers ganging up on me (along with a few male passengers as well) and no one supporting me (the guy next to me didn't utter a word), I stood no chance. I sat there silently for the next 10 min, with a burning red cheek and quietly alighted the bus when my destination arrived. That day I decided, I am never going to offer a seat to a women unless she is really old and literally can't stand or handicapped.
This might be a very rare incident, but I have seen women 'exploit' the reservations they get. You can't do anything you want just because you are a woman. Similarly, just because someone is a male, doesn't mean that he is at fault every time.
Our view of looking at men/women must change.

1033,"Q :Short Stories: What are some great short stories with a twist ending?

A : A certain private school was faced with a unique problem, where a number of 12-year old girls were beginning to use lipstick.

They would apply it from the restroom, which was fine. But after that they would press their lips on the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.

Every night the maintenance janitor would remove them, and the next day the girls would put them back. Finally the principal decided that something had to be done.

She called all girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance janitor. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the janitor who had to clean the mirrors every night (you can just imagine all the yawns from the little princesses).

To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance janitor to show the girls how much effort was required.

He took out a long-handed mop, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it.
 
Since then, there were no lip prints on the mirror.

1035,"Few years ago, while I was unmarried and was looking for a suitable match I registered myself on matrimonial sites (shaadi dot com and bharat matrimony) with a hope to get a similar minded person and a zero-showoff marriage. Also, my parents were looking for a suitable match via their personal & social connections.

A lot of phone conversations with prospects from the matrimonial sites used to consist of the following things...
It used to get clear in the very first few minutes of the conversation that the very reason why both of us chose to find a match via online matchmaking services was because we were looking for Open Minded, Educated, and Zero-Showoff, Dowry-Free marriage. And I used to get very happy that I am talking to such a modern person.
In the next few minutes details were exchanges. Details related to family, education, professional, misc details about friends and extended families. And till far, the discussion used to be a breeze.
One of the next topics used to be - Career plans after marriage. And I happily used to say that - It will be your choice, I will not interfere in your decision.
On the dowry issue, there was of course an agreement that I will not ask for dowry in any form.
So next I used to ask - So if things work out, when can you get married? The answer used to range from 3 months to a year. Which was absolutely fine.
At this point, almost all the girls I spoke to started taking discussing about the marriage planning, and the discussion used to go like this...
She: So where do you think we should get married?
Me: Either my town or your hometown or a neutral place.

She: I think it would be better if we go for your home town.
Me: Why So?

She: It would be easier for you to make the arrangements, hotel, reception, decorations, etc.
Me: But I thought we are going for a zero-showoff marriage. And I have already decided that I would go for court-marriage, followed by a small reception. And the entire event will be open only to extremely close members of the family and friends (not exceeding 20-25 people from each side).

She: Hmm....that sounds good, but don't you think its too simple shaadi? India mein aisa hota hai kya?
Me: Hota to nahin hai, but we are the ones who need to change things and start such good trends.

She: Ok, and how about jewellery and all?
Me: Whatever you wish you can buy, why would I have any issues with your jewellery. In any case you are one who is going to use it.

She: So, whats your budget?
Me: Budget for what?

She: Jewellery and other gifts which a bride gets from the groom's family.
Me: I thought we are going for a dowry-free marriage?

She: Yeah, but this is Indian custom. Groom's family has to gift jewellery items.
Me: *silence in shock*

{and at this point I had already made up mind, but then thought of testing my patience for a few minutes}

Me: Ok, fine. Agreed. So, lets do it this way. The marriage will be in your hometown. Baarat will consist of around 200 people. Make the arrangements in a good hotel. The marriage arrangements should be taken care by your family. All these expenses will be split between yours and my family. And I guess the expenses would be around 20Lac each side.
She: But thats not possible. Its dowry!

*Totally pissed by now*

Me : So girl, if you have to spend anything its dowry, and if we need to spend something it comes under the purview of Indian Customs! How fair is that?

She: *Hangs Up The Phone*

Its a real story. And I have tried speaking to almost 10-12 girls while I was looking for a suitable match.

Its painful how girls find it absolutely ridiculous to give any dowry (which is great), but then expect a modified form of dowry in return from the groom's family.

1037,"Question: What are some of the best random conversations you have ever had with an autorickshaw or a taxi driver?

Soumadeep's Answer: I belong to a city where people talk a lot. One can expect a conversation almost every time you sit in the front seat of a autorickshaw. But one certain conversation still stirs me up till day.
Setting :

It was a hot, sultry summer morning. I had the weekend off and hence I decided to hoof it to the nearby mall. I live in a paying guest facility on the first floor of a three storeyed building. The room does not have air-conditioning and as such I was sweating like pig due to the Kolkata humidity. After an almost sleepless night, I thought the mall AC and the early morning walk would relieve me. Unfortunately, after walking a few yards or so, I had the heartbreaking epiphany that mornings here are just as intolerable as nights. So, I decided to catch myself an auto rickshaw.

Action :

No sooner did I settle in the front seat, than the driver sensed my frustration and disgust at the terrible weather. So, he strikes up a conversation. As the discourse took place in Bengali, translating it in English might diminish the humor content. I sincerely hope one would pardon that.

Discourse :

Driver: Such a terrible weather, eh?

Me: Yes. The morning is no better.

Driver: I know. I started my shift at 4 in the AM. Not a relief.

Me: Tell me about it. How does one survive here?

Driver: Last night, we had to sleep in the verandah, it was so hot inside.

Me: There is like no wind, and the fan does nothing to dry off the sweat..

Driver: We have a table fan, and there are three of us. We fight every night about who will be the one to sleep nearest to the fan. (Laughs).
So, you don't have an AC?

Me: I live in dorm here. I have one at home.

Driver: Oh. I feel bad for you. You all have to struggle so much to study in colleges. Leave your homes, stay away. I guess the food ain't too good either.

Me: (Somewhat surprised that he is offering me sympathy) No. It's not good.

Driver: I have made a work schedule. In the summer. I don't go home in the afternoon. After starting a shift from 4 AM, if I go back home, in the noon for lunch, my body will simply refuse to come back to work. So, I carry my tiffin with me, and sometimes I eat at the roadside stalls.

Me: I see.

Driver: My wife asks me to come back. You see, eating outside burns a huge hole in my pocket. At home, I can eat simply eat Panta bhat (don't be mislead by the fancy wikipedia picture, it's actually just rice soaked in water) with a chilli.

Me: You could go home occasionally.

Driver: If I do, I would lose almost 2 hours of work. Plus once I go home, I don't feel like coming back in this heat.

Me: (Made a sad face)
Driver: So, I just pull the entire shift, till 11 at night and then go home. Go home, take a bath, and you know, sip some ""tonic"" (he meant alcohol), and then eat dinner. (Chuckles). ""Tonic""! Sir, ""tonic"". One can't survive in this heat without some heat in his belly. (Laughs hysterically).

Me: (Now totally engrossed in his words) Then?

Driver: Then my wife cooks some delicious dal vada and we eat together. We always eat together. Then I talk to my son. He is now in third grade now. I leave him at school every morning before the other kids arrive. No one wants to be seen with a auto rickshaw driver as a father. (Laughs).

Me: (Literally a bit teary eyed) Wow. it's nice that you are educating him.

Driver: What nice, sir. We try to make the best of what we have. Even if my son goes to school with the rich kids, he won't make it very long. Now, I can manage with my earnings. What happens after school? I can never pay for a college. Even I completed my schooling, look where I am now. Never mind, where to?

Me: South City mall.

Driver: Everyday we pass by the mall you are going to, yet, I have never been inside. My kid keeps insisting.

Me: You can. Even I don't buy anything there. But it's nice to just roam about.

Driver: Leave it sir. We like to live and dream within our means. Go, enjoy your AC. (Smiles)

Conclusion :

Till this day I regret not having paid him a little more than his fare. While I was whining and complaining about a little extra heat, he was pulling an all day shift and yet finding enough time for his family. He taught me more in twenty minutes than my four years of college. He knew how to be happy within his means. How much to dream, and how to enjoy the small moments. I always talk to drivers on my commute, but this, stands out.

             Once upon a time there was a rich King who had four wives.

             He loved the 4th wife the most and adored her with rich robes and treated her to the finest of delicacies. He gave her nothing but the best.

             He also loved the 3rd wife very much and was always
showing her off to neighbouring kingdoms. However, he feared that one day she would leave him for another.

             He also loved his 2nd wife. She was his confidant and was always kind, considerate and patient with him. 

             Whenever the King faced a problem, he could confide in her, and she would help him get through the difficult times.

             The King's 1st wife was a very loyal partner and had made great contributions in maintaining his wealth and kingdom. However, he did not love the first wife. Although she loved him deeply, he hardly took notice of her!

             One day, the King fell ill and he knew his time was short.
He thought of his luxurious life and wondered, I now have four wives with me, but when I die, I'll be all alone.""

Thus, he asked the 4th wife , ""I loved you the most, endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me
company?""

              ""No way!"", replied the 4th wife, and she walked away without another word.
             Her answer cut like a sharp knife right into his heart.

             The sad King then asked the 3rd wife, ""I loved you all my 
life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?""

              ""No!"", replied the 3rd wife. ""Life is too good!
             When you die, I'm going to remarry!""
             His heart sank and turned cold.

             He then asked the 2nd wife, ""I have always  turned to you for help and you've always been there for me.

            When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?""

             ""I'm sorry, I can't help you out this time!"", replied the 2nd wife. ""At the very most, I can only walk with you to your grave.""

 Her answer struck him like a bolt of lightning, and the King was devastated. Then a voice called out: ""I'll go with you.
I'll follow you no matter where you go.""

             The King looked up, and there was his first wife. She was very skinny as she suffered from malnutrition and neglect.

             Greatly grieved, the King said, ""I should have taken much
better care of you when I had the chance!""

             In truth, we all have the 4 wives in our lives:

             Our 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and
effort we lavish in making it look good, it will leave us when we die.

             Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, it will all go to others.

             Our 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how much they have been there for us, the farthest they can stay  by us is up to the grave.

             And our 1st wife is our Soul. Often neglected in pursuit of wealth, power pleasures of the world.

However, our Soul is the only thing that will follow us where ever we go. Cultivate, strengthen and cherish it now, for it is the only part of us that will follow us to the throne of God and continue with us throughout Eternity.

1061,"One of our best posts yet..!!

Question: ""What myths do we most commonly realize are false in our 20s?""

Carolyn's Answer: Since I recently turned 30, this is a particularly timely question for me! 

Here are the myths I've let go of over the last 10 years: 

1. Being in a happy relationship means that you will never again feel_______ (insert depressed, lonely, scared, insecure, etc). 
As an awkward girl who spent most of high school and college dateless, I often thought that being in a relationship would somehow ""solve"" all my problems. Thinking that being in a relationship will instantly solve your problems is a pipe dream. A happy, loving relationship is one life's greatest joys, but it can't solve the things you don't like about yourself. You have to do that, with work. 

2. Being good at school means you'll be good at work. Achieving academically by no means guarantees workplace success. I've had to swallow a big humility pill as I watch former fellow students who struggled through classes I breezed through now massively outpace me in career achievement. Being a great student does not mean you'll be great in the workplace. And that's OK. 

3. Physical fitness doesn't matter, being thin matters. Being skinny does not matter. Being physically fit really, really matters. Eat lots of healthful food and get tons of exercise. Ignore the scale. 

4. Everyone has to like you. Inevitably, someone will always dislike you. I wish I had figured this out a lot earlier and stopped trying so hard and worrying so much about it. I could have used all that time and put it to doing something far more fun and interesting, like learning a new language or playing the piano. Heck, watching Project Runway reruns would have been a better use of time. 

5. Quit something when you fail. Just because you fail at something does not mean you should quit, especially if it gives you joy or stretches you mentally. Everyone fails. Keep trying. 

6. Getting rejected is the worst thing that can happen. It really isn't. In fact, it can be a really good thing. Whether it was getting dumped or getting fired from a job, looking back I can honestly say that rejection taught me far more and had long-lasting positive benefits beyond whatever successes I've had. Getting fired from my first office job made me realize that no one in the working world cared about my kickass 100 page honors thesis on Jonathan Franzen and that I better learn some real workplace skills, fast. Getting fired and waking up the next day as usual made me realize that failure isn't the end of the world. Getting dumped taught me the difference between a good and a bad relationship, something I already knew inside but refused to accept until the bad relationship was over. Getting dumped made me a better person for the amazing man I get to be married to today. When rejection teaches you something new and positive, then that's actually a pretty great thing. 

7. Talking is more powerful than listening. I'm a lot quieter and more introverted these days and happier being so. Not all silence needs to be filled.

1065,"Question: Is India really changing?

Answer:  The other day I was searching for a rickshaw outside a DDA market in Delhi with one of my friends. We found a rickshaw,  the rickshaw-puller of which was too old and seemed a bit distressed. My friend went for another rickshaw, saying this guy was too old. I insisted and we sat on this rickshaw.
While on our journey, we started a conversation with this rickshaw-puller, curious to know the reason why he looked so distressed.

What we came to know during our conversation shocked us.
He was above 75 years of age.
People usually avoid sitting on his rickshaw as he was too old.
He could barely earn much to feed himself in a month, some-days going back home penniless.
His wife died a few months back as he did not have money to buy medicines.

I inquired more as to what benefits he gets from the government and came to know that he had been duped by agents promising to get him an old-age pension.
I asked for his phone number and address. He belonged to Darbhanga, Bihar.

I sent an e-mail, at around 10 in the night, to the Collector of his district with his contact details and address, asking to help him get an old-age pension.

Unbelievably, the next morning at around 10 I got a call from some Assistant Social Development Officer of the district informing me that he was assigned to look after this matter. And that, by then, the rickshaw-puller's family had already been contacted and was assigned an employee to help him get his old-age pension at the very earliest.

This absolutely is a change!

1069,"Few Reasons Why Bohemia Will Always Be The King Of Desi Hip Hop

Rewind to the year 2006 – Indian hip-hop lovers were still hung over on 50 Cent’s Massacre album, and most ‘pseudo hip-hop lovers’ were lip-syncing to Eminem’s tracks. Then out of nowhere, a desi rapper going by the name of Bohemia (from America) drops an album called ‘Pesa Nasha Pyar’ and the genre that we call ‘Punjabi Rap’ is born.

Fast forward to 2015, and the likes of Honey Singh, Raftaar etc.have ruined the same genre in the name of hip hop. Okay, if there’s a Jay-Z or Nas or Talib Kweli of desi hip hop, it’s Bohemia. And if there’s a Pitbull or Flo-Rida of desi hip hop, it’s these ‘supposed rappers’ Honey Singh, Raftaar  and others who follow suit. It’s not hard to guess who the legends are and will always be. Here are few reasons why Bohemia will always be the undisputed king of Desi Hip hop.

1. He Single-Handedly Created The Genre Of ‘Punjabi Rap/Hip Hop’
2. He Is An Inspired Lyricist Who Impeccably Weaves His Lyrics Around His Life And Times
3. He Is The Only Punjabi Rapper Who Is ‘Actually Rapping’ And Making Sense Out Of It
4. He Is Not A Sell-Out Like The Majority Of So-Called Punjabi Rappers
5. He Is Probably The Only ‘Desi Rapper’ Who Knows What Hip Hop Actually Is
6. The First And Only Desi Rapper To Have Collaborated With Legendary Mainstream Hip Hop Artists like Snoop Dogg, Sin and Glasses Malone
7. He Is Hands Down The Only Punjabi Rapper Who ‘Actually’ Represents Desi Hip Hop Globally In The Truest Manner

ONE OF THE MOST UP-VOTED ANSWER ON QUORA (31K+)

QUESTION: How does it feel to have sex with your spouse on your wedding night when he/she is a stranger?

Anonymous's Answer:

I was almost raped on my wedding night.

I am sure it may not be this way for all weddings out there. I am not even saying that this is the case for many weddings. But yes, if you are getting into this, you should always know that this is a possibility that you cannot ignore, and which no one would ever tell you.

I hail from a typical middle class background, from a not-so-big town in (South) India, and after I turned 22, everyone around me was worried that now is the time for me to get married otherwise I would never get married/ bring shame to my family/ marry after my younger siblings get married/ run off with someone (yes, they said all these things in front of me!) so, yes, I needed to be married off to someone, who was not my boyfriend.

Now, there's a culture in South India, if a family doesn't have a lot of money -- girls are married to their cousins/ mother's brother, where the age difference is not too much (say the mother was the eldest daughter, and brother was the youngest, with a huge age gap). This way, a girl stays 'within the family', and also there is no question of dowry, since they are family.

Similar to this, my wedding was arranged right after I graduated from college, to my ""mama"" (mother's brother) who was a few years older than me. My case was complicated because I had a boyfriend already, and my family didn't approve of him when I told them about him (he was not South Indian, which was a mortal sin in my parents' eyes). I tried to protest, but using the usual emotional blackmail arguments, my father forced me into the marriage - he was very sick at the time, and the onus was on me to ""fulfill his wishes."" (He's very much fine now, but I am inclined to think he'll fall sick again when it's my younger sister's turn to get married. Indian parents force you to think this stuff about themselves).

I was forced to break off all contact with my boyfriend (mobile, internet snatched away, I don't think I could even have sent a letter, it was so bad) and forced to dive head-first into the wedding arrangements.

The day of the wedding came, and after a really embarrassing lecture from my mother, about my ""marital duties"" since I was the eldest daughter and no friends had been allowed to my wedding (my parents believed they would whisk me away from the wedding if they came to know), I got ready for the ""wedding night."" I was already feeling completely shitty about the whole thing, having been cut off from every person that I wanted to be with, being married to my 'mama' in secrecy, and not even knowing whether to think of him as a husband or my mama, and  just wanted to sleep hoping a new day would bring a new start.

I waited for my husband to come and when he entered, we exchanged a few awkward sentences about the whole day being tiresome. I then told him ""I'm feeling very tired, I will change and go to sleep now"" but I was not prepared for what happened next. He suddenly kissed me, and I was a little taken aback, but I just pulled away slowly, and told him that I was not in the mood, and reiterated that I was very tired. He ignored me completely, and kissed me again, this time with more force, and when I tried to push him away, he slapped me.

This was followed by the most horrible experience of my life, the details of which shake me to this day, and I somehow escaped by locking myself in the bathroom.

I knew I had nobody to turn to -- he was my mother's brother, and my father was sick. Even if these were not the circumstances, I doubt anyone would have supported me.

I stayed in this abusive marriage for a few months, which was the darkest period of my life. Thankfully, I was not foolish, and I had a job to support myself, unlike a lot of other women out there, suffering daily. I ran away, before it was too late. Now, nobody in my family knows where I am, and what happened. I am sure they must say the worst things about me, and mention my name with disgust and shame. But this is one decision that I made with careful deliberation and I will not let myself regret it. I am considerably happier now, very much single, with no intention of getting married again.

I am happy to have put this behind me, but want to extend my support for all those women who are in the same situation as I was. One experience is enough to scar you for life.

Answer By An Anonymous on Quora

Sorry for the long post

I am from India. I was raped when I was a teen and I had no self confidence due to this issue and the way my relatives and sometimes the way my own family treated me. My studies went downhill and I was a top scorer downgraded to above average scorer. Also, with my bronze complexion and being too thin, wearing braces for my teeth and also being very naive, i became a joke for all my so called 'friends'. They used to tease me about my looks, my body, complexion, etc.

Years passed I took up a job in a reputed MNC and a guy confessed his love for me. I never believed any guy would accept me due to the past incident and I informed the guy about the same to reject his proposal. But he forced me and also due to my family pressure accepted for the wedding. After 3 months, When I was sick and went to my parents place only to know that he told his family about me and they planned to marry just to get some money from me. They started making rules as to provide my entire salary to my father in law and I should ask him permission to even go out with my husband or even to buy a sanitary napkin from him. I never went back when they demanded money citing my past and he sent divorce papers when he knew he wont get money from me.He also insulted me that I will never get married, as second marriage and all the issues will get me nowhere in India. In short, being a girl my life is doomed.

I completely lost hope and started in self destruction mode of not eating, sleeping and not caring anything about my health. I had a friend and i started loving him, as naturally he was the only one who was trying to make me smile inspite of all the troubles I had in my life. when I confessed my love, he never rejected but he was unemployed at that time. But he had only a house(His father's) in a very expensive area in the city. But he used to invite me almost everyday to go out to eat or watch movie and I used to spend for him literally everything.Food, clothes, entertainment, fuel, etc. After he got a job, without telling me, he got engaged to a girl of his parent's choice. Also my so called 'friends' left me when I tried standing up for myself and they were also putting me down as I am a divorcee and trying to confine me in a circle. I tried killing myself and failed. 

My cousins, meanwhile went to study abroad and climbing higher in career and life. Some of my Uncle and aunt stopped talking my parents because they are not as rich as my relatives and also due to my issues. 

2 years ago, I left India and came to an European country for my job. 

- Started getting new friends and i was determined to stay alone and be independent. 
- Started exploring cooking food, travel
- I had more time to read and develop my interest 
- Started learning the language of the region
- Made a trip with one of my good long lost friend and it was a great trip to talk, share and connect ideas and fun
- Took care and evolved to dress up and carry myself confidently according to the region

Now

- All my friends here adore all the features of my look and personality
- I bought an apartment in India which is much more expensive than my so called Friend and my Ex husband
- Am a proud self made independent woman realizing my dreams half way and lot more to go
- As for my relatives, They all came back to talk to my parents when they knew we have come up in life but as they learnt the lesson, they don't encourage them
- I met my life partner - an European, with so much better moral values in  person and who adores everything about me and calls me princess every time. He completely adores me and we are engaged as we both make each other chase our dreams and pushing ourselves to move ahead
- And As for that guy who tricked me in to spending, When I went to India for my holidays, I met him and he is still the same trying to get some money, took me to a shop to buy some headphones for him. After he chose, at the counter, he asked me to pay, I said, You pay or ask your wife to pay and at that moment, when he realized he wont get a penny, and he could not leave the shop with insult, he paid for it. And after he never spoke to me again.
- For my so called friends, they are still in some normal jobs in India having a low life and spreading some shit story of me
- last but not least, my current friends circle, each and everyone of them, some even in quora, are real gems and every conversation with them is so positive and everyone inspires me to be a better persona and adore their good moral values in life and these people also will support me in every way when I have an issue. 

I am waiting for the moment for the karma to strike on my Ex husband when he will know about my life partner :) :)

Here is a way:-

It was my first date with Sneha and we were in a café which was filled with couples. I always wanted to come to this café with a beautiful girl whom I could adore for hours. So I was living my dream with Sneha. She had big beautiful eyes, very long hairs and a sparkling smile. We hadn’t started talking when a waiter came and gave us a menu.
“So what would you like to order?” Sneha asked me with a sweet smile on her face.
“Order me any mocktail” I replied and then Sheha ordered some fast food, Panipuri and a Pommeade for me. We talked for like 10 minutes and then the waiter came and served me a drink but it was not what I’d ordered.
“This is not what I’d ordered” I yelled at waiter.
“I know sir, this is from that ma’am sitting at that corner.” Waiter pointed out at a girl sitting alone in this couple café. We both instantly looked at that girl and then looked at each other in surprise.
“Do you know her?” Sneha hesitantly asked me.
“No, I’m seeing her first time in my life” I replied
“She is staring at you” Sneha chuckled. I avoided looking at her.
“She must have sent that drink for you” I told Sneha.
“No no, She’s no way a lesbian” Sneha laughed.
“But she is looking rich, look at her heavy make-up and food on her table” I said.
“Is she going to eat all that alone?” Sneha laughed again.
“Now stop looking at her. I want to enjoy my evening with the beautiful girl I’m sitting with” I told Sneha and then I looked into her eyes. She blushed. 
After a few seconds, the waiter came and served us what we’d ordered. We started eating.
“But she is still staring at you” Sneha irritatingly told me.
“Are you jealous?” I chuckled
“Why won’t I be jealous? ” Sheha replied and then she touched my promise finger.
After eating when we were about to leave, Sneha asked me to talk to her but then I told her that I didn’t want to spend this precious time with anyone else. Sneha looked at that girl again and hugged me out of jealousy and then Sneha gave her a harsh look.
After dropping Sneha at her hostel, I came back to that café again.
“Why were you staring us so badly?” I shouted on that girl.
“Because I’m in love with you” She replied in soft voice
“I love you too baby” I high-fived her.
“But you are a pathetic actor.” She mocked
“So are you.” I grinned.
“I told you, this plan would work” She laughed
“Yeah you know everything and thank you so much Anjali” I thanked her
“We don’t thank our best friends stupid!” she screamed at me.
“Some people know all your best stories but only a best friend has lived them with you.”

Scene : One fine Evening. Me, my friend, our laptops, his room. 
He is playing Counter Strike on his laptop. He is too preoccupied to take notice of what is about to happen.
I am pretending to watch a movie on mine. Something sinister is being planned by my mind. 
I see his phone. I pick it up. He knows nothing. 
Like most of my friends in the college, he doesn't use a screen lock. He uses one of the customized app locks so popular on app markets, like the Smart AppLock. So he has a lock on his Whatsapp, Facebook, Messenger, Hike, Instagram, Gmail and so on. But not a screen lock.
I find the app lock icon in the menu. I touch and hold it. 
I drag it to the UNINSTALL option. 
BAZZINGA !!! He hasn't set a lock for the Phone's Package Installer. How naive? xD
Now as the App Lock is uninstalled, I see endless opportunities in front of me. He is still busy playing. He still knows nothing. 
Next, I install App Lock again. But this time, the password is mine. The Joker inside me is smiling. I set the password to all the usual stuff, plus the package installer, phone settings, and the caller. You will see why this is important. 
I place the phone exactly where it was placed. I go back to business as usual.
By the way, this friend in consideration, is in a relationship, with a short-tempered girl. (*Silent Clapping*)
Now watch as the drama unfolds.

He receives a Whatsapp message. Probably from his girl. He tries to open Whatsapp. 
First try : Unsuccessful
Second Try : Unsuccessful
Next, 8-9 Tries : Unsuccessful 
Now he is starting to worry. His girlfriend is obsessive. She keeps on sending him messages. He can read them, but not reply. He tries, and fails, and tried and fails. 
Now he does what a predictable prey does. He opens the app lock. But password on it too. He tries to uninstall it. But VOILA, that requires a password too. He tries to open phone Settings. But DAMN, password here too.
His girlfriend is getting more furious every passing second. He is starting to sweat now. He doesn't want to face the wrath of his angry girlfriend. 
Next, he plans to call her. But, I have planned something different for him. Now even calling and receiving requires a password (LOL !!!). He can't call anybody. Now he is seriously worried and frustrated. His girlfriend has stopped messaging. 
Next, he receives a call from her. That poor guy. Can't pick up her phone. 
She calls again, and again for a third time. But without the correct password, he can't pick up.  His tension and frustration have reached new heights. 
I am silently enjoying all this, and laughing in my mind. But I am pretending to help him. How evil of me. ^_^

Oh, and I forgot to mention a thing. When I had full access to his Whatsapp, I changed his status to something like : 

I am proud to be gay! :)

Two of our friends enter the room breaking the news to him : 

Bhai, tune bataya nahi kabhi to gay hai? Hume to pehle se hi shak tha!! 
( Bro, you never told us that you were gay? We had our doubts from the start!!)

I started laughing so hard, I fell from the bed. I am not able to see him in pain anymore. I break out to him my all plan. I unlock his phone, all of us have a good laugh, and then I nearly got murdered. :)

1116,"Question: What is the bravest thing you have ever done or said?

Ans: Being a woman, I get stares, catcalls and groped on an almost daily basis. However, my Dad always taught me since a very young age that if a man were to ever inappropriately touch me, I shouldn't stay silent about it. As a result, I've faced some ugly circumstances and situations most people would like to avoid being in. I remember two particular incidents that are still fresh in my mind though:

1. I was 14, and walking home from school. A well-dressed man who looked like he was in his early 20s was walking towards me. I was lost in my own thoughts when I was walking, and as our paths crossed, he reached out and groped my chest. The moment this happened, I was confused for a second and stood frozen to the ground, not knowing how to react. I wheeled back, only to see the guy walking away casually, sniggering. He didn't even run, because he assumed I wouldn't do much.
I threw my only weapon, a 500 ml nearly-empty plastic water bottle aimed straight for his head. My aim being so excellent, it went a few metres past his head, and he ended up tripping on the bottle, falling to the ground. I ran up to him, landed good kicks in his groin, screamed, called for help. Some people stopped their cars, asked me if I was alright, landed punches on him, verbally abused him, and even offered him advice. He ended up in tears and apologized. People talked me out of filing an FIR because they said it would be a hassling affair. I believed it and moved on. One less pervert in the world.

I noticed his BDS degree on the wall, which bore his full name.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then?
Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate.

The way I understand the term 'exceptional life', you can always choose to start living an exceptional life any moment. You are not doomed to live an unexceptional life. What is probably the source of confusion for you is that you are subscribing to standardized materialistic version of 'exceptional life' that you have been indoctrinated with since childhood - things like making huge money in job or reaching influential positions to get media coverage because people around you thought that the only use of intelligence is to make money or having the power to get things done.

What makes people exceptional for me is the uniqueness of what they think, how they react to their surroundings, their attitudes towards different issues and problems and the strength of their character. I have met exceptional people in all shades of life. Exceptional people can be poor and wear torn clothes, 'educated' or 'uneducated' (in the sense of certificates), married or unmarried, employed or unemployed, may have children or be childless. Lots of people are making a positive difference to the world in their own ways. No matter how trapped you may feel by the superficial circumstances of your life, it's always your choice to break free and think beyond it. You don't need society's validation of your actions (as long as it does not violate some standardized base ethical concepts). You need your own validation. Stand apart from the herd, be an independent thinker and challenge the authorities and conventions - not in a teenage hysterical way but someone as a well informed rational and sensitive citizen of the world. Sure you may never be in the front page of newspapers, but the faces in newspapers are rarely people whom I would likely to classify as 'exceptional'"

There was a family with one kid.
One day the Mom was out and Dad was in charge of the kid.
Someone had given the kid a little 'tea set' as a birthday gift and it was one of his favorite toys. 

Daddy was in the living room when the kid brought Daddy a little cup of 'tea', which was just water.
After several cups of tea and lots of praise from his Dad for such yummy tea, kid’s Mom came home
.
Dad made her wait in the living room to watch the kid bring him a cup of tea, because it was 'just the cutest thing !!'

Mom waited, and sure enough, the kid comes down the hall with a cup of tea for Daddy and she watches him drink it up,
Then she says to him,
""Did it ever come to your mind that the only place that baby can reach to get water is the toilet comode ?""   🚽 🚽 🚽

MORAL : Dad loves you but Mom knows you..!"

I thought this letter is worth sharing.

Open Letter to Bilawal Bhutto
Dear Bilawal ji,
Pehle to wish you a very happy birthday. 26! Such a special age. Reminds me too of the time when i was young and stupid, though maybe not this much. As a special gift for your happy day, you are trending on social media and every Indian is talking about you. How’s that for neighborly love? Say thanks. Where are your manners, yaar?

I heard video clip with great interest. The one where you said that you will make sure that you get every inch of Kashmir for Pakistan. Boss, such determination at this young age is something to be proud of. You should pat your back for having such clarity of thought when most Indians your age these days focus on cramming concepts of java and sql to get a job offer with a grand 50% hike at that Gurgaon MNC. Tells you something about misplaced priorities.

Going back to the speech. I love the raw josh and enthusiasm with which you spoke the words. ‘lawange lawange…kashmir…poora ka poora kashmir….pakistan da kashmir….lawange.‘ The way you raised your hands, pumped up the vocal cords, and spoke, like a WWE announcer, except that your voice hasn’t even broken yet, which made it sound more adorable than terrifying. Add to that your smashing looks, and boss, if i had been there, i would have kissed your cheek and pinched those shiny cheeks of yours out of purely platonic love. You sly fox, you are going to get votes from women for being cute and from men for this speech.
Boss, Kashmir to nahi mil payega. I mean you are cute and all that, you may have had an affair with the pretty lady minister whose handbag is worth more than the rest of Pakistan, but who said life is fair? You want Kashmir. Yo Yo Honey Singh wants a Grammy. I want an iPhone 6. Tough luck.

But we can manage another gift for you. A time machine. Yea baby, you heard it right. I can help you look into the future and see what life has in store for you.
There is a man, 44 years old, fair and lovely like you, youth heart-throb like you, England educated like you, born of political pedigree like you, and when he speaks it is the right mix of comedy and sincerity for his people. I present to you Rahul Gandhi. He is you, in 18 years. He is your time-machine. Just look at him to see what you are going to become. You’re welcome.
You know what all of India is thinking today? That India and Pakistan are so similar. We have the same cultures. We eat the same roti and butter chicken. We listen to the same pirated Bollywood music. Our Cricket teams are equally inconsistent and prone to temptations. Our Hockey teams had their moments of glory but now mostly suck at the world stage. Our politicians are a similar bunch of jokers. Our girls on both sides swoon when Shahrukh Khan opens his arms in his trademark gesture.
We have Rahul. They have you. See. Same to same.

Back to Kashmir. Come on yaar. Don’t look so sad. Okay we can try one thing. Why don’t you come on Arnab ji’s News Hour for a panel discussion and explain why you should get the state over which your country has got its ass whooped by India four times in the last 60 odd years? Fair deal?

If you can manage to speak ten complete uninterrupted sentences on his show, you can have the state.Bolo chalega? The only catch is that if you fail, you will watch Arbaaz Khan’s ‘Ma Tujhe Salaam’ on loop for a month and do the chicken- dance every time he says ‘doodh maangoge to kheer denge. Kashmir maangoge to cheer denge.’"

Question: What's  a funny short story??

Answer: A Secretary Got An Expensive Pen As Birthday Gift From His Boss.
She Sent His Boss A ‘Thank You Note’ Via E-Mail.
But, Her Boss’s Wife Read The Note And Filed A Divorce.
The Note Was
“Your Penis Wonderful, I Enjoyed Using It Last Night.
It Has Extra-Ordinarily Smooth Flow And Firm Strokes.
Initially Its Tip Was To Be Licked To Bring It In Working Order And Then It Was Equally On Both Sides.
I Loved Its Perfect Size And Grip.
I Felt As In Heavens Using It.
I Had Always Desired It And Fulfilled My Wish.
At Last It Is Mine And Only Mine, Forever.
Thanks A Lot.”

1166,"What is a short story which can enlighten me on life problems?

The Eagle has the longest life-span of its species. It can live upto 70 years.
But to reach this age, the eagle must make a very difficult decision!

In its 40th year, the eagle's long and flexible Talons can no longer grab a prey which serves as food.

Its long and sharp beak becomes bent.

Its old-aged and heavy wings, due to their thick feathers, stick to its chest and make it difficult to fly.

Then, the eagle is left with only two options: DIE or go through a painful process of CHANGE!

This process lasts for 150 days (5 months)

The process requires the eagle to fly to a mountain top and sit on its nest. 

There the eagle knocks its beak against a rock until it plucks it out.

Then the eagle will wait for the new beak to grow back after which it will pluck out its talons. When its talons grow back, the eagle starts plucking its old aged feathers.

And after this the eagle takes its famous flight of rebirth and LIVES for 30 more years!!

Why is Change needed???

In order to survive and live. We too have to start the change process.

We sometimes need to get rid of the unpleasant old memories, negative habits and our fixed mind set.

Only Freed from the past burdens can we take advantage of the present.

If an eagle can make a life saving and life changing decision at the age of 40....why can't we?

In order to take on a New Journey ahead, let go of your negative old limiting beliefs.

Open up your mind and let yourself fly high like an eagle!
When it rains, all birds occupy shelter. But the EAGLE avoids the rain by 
flying above the clouds....

The problem is common to all but the attitude to solve it makes the difference!
Don't be afraid of change...accept it gracefully..!!!"
